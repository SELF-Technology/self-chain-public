Most blockchain projects are isolated islands, not part of a unified and functioning ecosystem. There are certainly many unification and interoperability efforts ongoing, but we’ve yet to see a solution in the form of an operating system that glues it all together. Nor an operating system, outside of the usual suspects, that is beautiful to use. In our view, any player in the space who wishes to scale an alternative vision needs to embrace a holistic and unified approach with outstanding user experience.","sidebar":"docs"},"roadmap/SDK":{"id":"roadmap/SDK","title":"SDK","description":"The SELF SDK will be initially developed on the SELF Chain Testnet, enabling developers to build apps for the Super-App and, therefore, the eventual OS.
