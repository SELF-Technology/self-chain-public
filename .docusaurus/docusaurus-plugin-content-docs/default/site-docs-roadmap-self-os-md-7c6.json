  "description": "SELF OS will work similarly to a typical operating system in terms of having numerous applications that assist with various tasks, from communication to note-taking and scheduling to purchasing. However, all the innate applications will be linked to one another by each user‚Äôs SELF AI, meaning that their individual preferences are part of how the applications work. Any external application that makes such interactions possible will also be integrated. This will enable an entirely new experience of interacting with an operating system.",
