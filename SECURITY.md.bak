## Quantum Security Approach

The SELF Chain implements a forward-looking hybrid cryptographic approach that combines classical cryptographic algorithms with post-quantum resistant algorithms. This provides the security and performance benefits of well-established cryptographic methods while ensuring protection against future quantum computing threats.

### Key Quantum Security Components

1. **Hybrid Cryptography Implementation**
   - All sensitive data is protected using both classical (e.g., X25519, Ed25519) and post-quantum (e.g., Kyber, SPHINCS+) algorithms
   - Fallback mechanisms ensure continued operation if vulnerabilities are discovered in any single algorithm

2. **Algorithm Agility**
   - Modular design allows for rapid replacement of cryptographic primitives
   - Support for cryptographic algorithm negotiation during handshake
   - Regular security audits to assess the need for algorithm updates

3. **Post-Quantum Key Exchange**
   - Implementation of Kyber key encapsulation mechanism
   - Quantum-resistant shared secret establishment
   - Hybrid key exchange combining classical and post-quantum methods

4. **Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures**
   - SPHINCS+ hash-based signature scheme implementation
   - Secure against both classical and quantum adversaries
   - Used for critical verification operations in the blockchain
