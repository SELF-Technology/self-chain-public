## Documentation Folder Naming Convention

**CRITICAL RULE**: All folders in `/docs` must start with a capital letter.

### Allowed Examples:
- `/docs/Architecture/` ✅
- `/docs/Grid Compute/` ✅  
- `/docs/API/` ✅
- `/docs/SDK/` ✅
- `/docs/Constellation/` ✅

### Not Allowed:
- `/docs/architecture/` ❌
- `/docs/constellation/` ❌
- `/docs/api/` ❌

This rule is enforced to maintain consistency across all public documentation. Acronyms (API, SDK, etc.) are acceptable in full caps.

**Note**: This rule applies only to direct subdirectories of `/docs`. Files within folders can use any naming convention appropriate for their content type.
