# AI Training System

## Overview
The AI Training System is a core component of the SELF Chain's governance mechanism, providing continuous learning and optimization for AI validators. This system enables validators to improve their decision-making capabilities over time through machine learning techniques.

## Key Components

### 1. AITrainingSystem
The main training system that manages:
- Model training and updates
- Data collection and processing
- Performance monitoring
- Training scheduling

### 2. AIModel
The machine learning model that:
- Processes validation requests
- Evaluates voting patterns
- Updates reputation scores
- Learns from historical data

## Training Process

### Data Collection
The system collects three types of training data:

1. **Proposal Validation Data**
   - Proposal IDs
   - Validation results
   - Validation timestamps
   - Hex color matching patterns

2. **Voting Pattern Data**
   - Vote history
   - Voting power distribution
   - Proposal scores
   - Voting timestamps

3. **Reputation Data**
   - Reputation updates
   - Update reasons
   - Reputation changes
   - Update timestamps

### Model Training
The AI model uses a neural network-like structure with:
- Weights for different validation types
- Biases for decision thresholds
- Activation functions for scoring
- Continuous learning through backpropagation

## Performance Metrics

### Accuracy
- Validation accuracy
- Voting prediction accuracy
- Reputation update accuracy
- Overall model accuracy

### Training Time
- Model training duration
- Data processing time
- Prediction latency

### Resource Usage
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Network bandwidth

## Implementation Details

### Model Architecture
```java
public class AIModel {
    private Map<String, Double> weights;    // Validation weights
    private Map<String, Double> biases;     // Decision thresholds
    private Map<String, Double> activationFunctions;  // Scoring functions
}
```

### Training Process
```java
public void train(List<TrainingData> data) {
    // Update weights and biases
    for (TrainingData td : data) {
        double error = calculateError(td);
        updateWeights(error);
        updateBiases(error);
    }
    // Calculate accuracy
    double accuracy = calculateAccuracy(data);
}
```

## Security Features
