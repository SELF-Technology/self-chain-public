# SELF Tokenomics

The SELF Token ($SELF) is the core utility and governance token of the SELF ecosystem. It powers the upcoming super-app, future SELF-related products (whether developed in-house or by external teams), the SELF Constellation, and SELF Chain governance. Designed for long-term sustainability and value accrual, $SELF enables network operations, rewards participation, and incentivizes ecosystem growth.

> Note: The Stellar Network introduces a user growth model where daily usage is measured via non-transferable credits called "Stars". **Stars â‰  Tokens**. Stars reflect engagement; tokens represent transferable economic and governance value.
