# SELF Token Overview

## Leverage Your Data

The ultimate objective of the token is to help users recognize and harness the value of their personal data. This stands in stark contrast to how modern technology typically works‚Äîplatforms profit increasingly as users surrender more of their data.

## Purchase subscriptions and services with a discount

The SELF token will be used to purchase premium subscription to SELF and additional services with a discount.

## Trading Currency within the SELF Ecosystem

As the broader SELF ecosystem develops, the token will be the primary trading currency. This includes purchases, payments, decentralized applications on SELF chain and usage within SELF OS.

## Staking

Lock up tokens as a user or business client, to receive a staking APR and possibly discounts, whitelist and airdrops from ecosystem partners and teams building with the SELF SDK (subject to change, TBD).

## Referral Scheme and Points Program

SELF will incentivize activities that are beneficial to the development of the ecosystem via the referral scheme and our in-depth points program. More information to follow soon.

## Buyback Process

The buyback process is where a percentage of SELF's different revenue streams is used to buy the SELF token on exchanges, generating perpetual buy pressure. Of the tokens purchased, the usage will be split as follows:‚Äç

1. **Burning** (reducing distributed supply)
2. **Staking** (increasing APR for token holders)
3. **Premium** subscription rebates (reducing costs or enabling users to spend within the system)

The long-term goal for the SELF token is to become deflationary through such mechanisms.

## Earn Mechanism

A key feature of future SELF apps is the Earn mechanism. SELF will form affiliate partnerships across industries‚Äîtravel, health, software, entertainment, and more‚Äîeventually numbering in the thousands.

When users ask SELF for purchase help (e.g. recommendations or reviews), responses may include referral links. If a purchase is made, an off-chain process confirms payment and triggers an automatic buy of SELF tokens on a decentralized exchange. A large portion of the referral commission is used for this, with some tokens burned.

SELF tokens are credited to the user‚Äôs wallet quarterly, after refund windows close to prevent abuse. Tokens will be temporarily locked to ensure system integrity.

This creates consistent buy pressure on the SELF token, potentially supporting its value (though not guaranteed). Users will also be incentivized to hold rather than sell their tokens.

# üíé SELF Token-Based Subscription Model

## Overview

SELF Chain implements a revolutionary token-based subscription model that aligns with our decentralized vision and creates stronger community incentives. Instead of traditional credit card payments, users stake SELF tokens to access different service tiers.

## üåü Subscription Tiers

### Tier Structure & Pricing

| Tier | Monthly Price | Cloud Infrastructure | Target Users |
|------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Premium Preview** üí´üöÄ | $0 | 14-day enterprise experience: DeepSeek R1, unlimited premium AI | New users experiencing digital sovereignty |
| **SELF Cloud Starter** üöÄ | $8.99/month | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, unlimited AI | Budget-conscious users |
| **SELF Cloud Pro** ‚≠ê | $12.99/month | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB SSD, unlimited AI | Professional users |
| **SELF Cloud Pro+** üåü | $24.99/month | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB SSD, unlimited AI | Power users & developers |

### Dynamic Token Pricing

Since SELF is not a stablecoin, subscription tiers are priced in USD equivalent:
- Users purchase **$X worth** of SELF tokens, not a fixed token amount
- Real-time price feeds determine exact token quantity at purchase time
- Example: "SELF Cloud Pro: $12.99/month (currently ~X.XX SELF tokens)"

## üìä Key Concepts

### AI Power System

**AI Power** represents your monthly usage allowance:
- **Always starts at 100%** each billing cycle for all tiers
- **Depletes based on usage** (not time):
  - AI conversations: ~1% per extended session
  - VPN browsing: ~0.5% per GB
  - Messaging: ~0.1% per message
  - Wallet transactions: ~0.2% per transaction
- **When AI Power reaches 0%**, service pauses until next billing cycle or tier upgrade

### Subscription Tiers vs AI Power
- **Tier** = Your usage limits before AI Power depletes
- **AI Power** = How much of your monthly allowance remains
- Higher tiers have the same 100% AI Power but it depletes more slowly

## üîÑ Token Utility Model

### Staking Model (Preferred)
- **Stake tokens for tier access** (don't spend them)
- **Tokens remain in your wallet**, providing ongoing utility
- **Unstaking downgrades tier** after current period
- **Earn staking rewards** while subscribed

### Circular Economy
1. **Run node** ‚Üí Earn SELF tokens
2. **Use tokens** ‚Üí Upgrade subscription tier
3. **Higher tier** ‚Üí Access more features
4. **More usage** ‚Üí Greater network participation

## üåå Multiverse Tier - Cross-Constellation Access

The Multiverse Tier represents the pinnacle of individual SELF Chain participation, granting premium access across the entire Constellation ecosystem.

### Understanding the Constellation
- **Constellation Partners**: Enterprise organizations (Fortune 500, governments) that launch their own L1 chains
- **Constellation Chains**: Sovereign L1 blockchains created by partners
- **Multiverse Subscribers**: Individual power users with access across ALL Constellation Chains

### Core Multiverse Features
- **Universal Chain Access**: Use one identity across every Constellation Chain
- **Cross-Chain Compute Credits**: Your staked tokens provide compute on any chain
- **Unlimited Multi-Chain AI Power**: No usage limits across the entire ecosystem
- **Portfolio Dashboard**: Monitor all your cross-chain activities
- **Priority Bridge Access**: Fast inter-chain transfers and communications
- **Early Access Program**: First to use newly launched Constellation Chains
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Voting power that spans the entire ecosystem
- **Universal AI Access**: Use specialized AI models from any Constellation Chain

### Use Case Examples
A Multiverse subscriber could seamlessly:
1. **Execute** trades on a Finance Constellation Chain
2. **Verify** shipments on a Supply Chain Constellation Chain
3. **Access** medical records on a Healthcare Constellation Chain
4. **Vote** on governance across multiple chains

All with one subscription, one identity, and instant interoperability.

## üí∞ Benefits Over Traditional Subscriptions

1. **No Geographic Restrictions**: Global access without payment processor limitations
2. **User Investment**: Token holders become stakeholders in network growth
3. **Aligned Incentives**: Compute providers earn tokens, creating natural demand
4. **Decentralization**: No dependency on traditional finance infrastructure
5. **Network Effects**: Early adopters benefit from token appreciation

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: ERC-20 Token (Mobile App Launch)
- Deploy SELF as ERC-20 token on Ethereum/Polygon
- Integrate with DEXs for liquidity
- Accept USDC/USDT for initial token purchases

### Phase 2: Native Coin (Mainnet)
- Migrate to native SELF Chain coin
- Implement bridge for ERC-20 ‚Üí Native conversion
- Full integration with compute rewards

## üìà Future Considerations

### Long-Term Commitments
- 10% discount for annual staking
- Volume discounts for enterprise
- Early adopter rewards: Bonus AI Power for beta users

### Alternative Payment Options
For users who prefer traditional payments:
- **Crypto Payment Processors**: Coinbase Commerce, BitPay for stablecoin payments
- **Partner Exchanges**: Direct fiat-to-SELF conversion partnerships
- **Corporate Accounts**: Separate entity for enterprise fiat billing (future)

## üéØ Success Metrics
- Token holder retention rate
- Compute provider participation
- Average tier upgrade velocity
- Token circulation vs. staking ratio
- Network growth correlation with token adoption
