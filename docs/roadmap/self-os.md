# Operating System

SELF OS will function like a typical operating system with various apps for tasks like messaging, note-taking, scheduling, and shopping. But here, all apps are connected through each userâ€™s SELF AI, which personalizes how they work based on individual preferences. External apps that support this interaction can also be integrated, creating a new way to use an OS.

For example, when chatting about dinner plans, your SELF AI can simultaneously search for where to buy ingredients. Or if you plan your week verbally, SELF OS will check all your apps and help manage your tasks by activating relevant apps in the background.

Developers building apps for SELF OS can join a DAO to fund and support app development and network maintenance.

## Hardware Products & Infrastructure

Over time, hardware products will be offered directly or by licensed partners. This may include secure, privacy-conscious, productivity-optimized devices with SELF OS preinstalled. We are [concerned about blue light](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) and its [impact on heatlh](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-blue-light), so we will seek alternatives as a priority.

Depending on the target audience, various models could be available, including a very affordable device with budget specs and no internet access,meant to be used as a productivity-focused word processor with advanced AI capabilities and a workflow system with reward mechanisms, completely avoiding any possibility of getting distracted by the internet. Another could be task-specific devices (e.g., for video editing, designing, writing, producing music, etc.), with specs and prices adapted to what is needed for that task.

Some or all products could have an integrated gamification and reward mechanism for completing tasks, enabling the ecosystem to be circular and self-fulfilling. Literally.

Looking far ahead, expansion possibilities may include satellite internet infrastructure, amongst other innovations. Ultimately, we believe that technology and communication channels should be independent and self-sovereign.
