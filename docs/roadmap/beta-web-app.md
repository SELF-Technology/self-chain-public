# Beta Web App

The purpose of the Beta Web App was to simply test the agentic experience where SELF learned about each user during conversations (likes, dislikes, traits, habits, places you've been, goals, dreams etc.), and generated a user profile.

The Beta program closed in July 2025 in preparation for the Super-App launch.
