# SDK

The SELF SDK will be initially developed on the SELF Chain Testnet, enabling developers to build apps for the Super-App and, therefore, the eventual OS. Here are the guiding principles for all versions of the SDK:

**Simplicity** - The SDK should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and examples that enable developers to get started quickly and efficiently.

**Security** - The SDK should provide robust security features to protect user data and ensure the integrity of applications.

**Reliability** - Developers should be able to trust that the SDK and the underlying infrastructure is stable and reliable, with minimal downtime and consistent performance.

**Usability** - The SDK should be designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring that applications built with it are intuitive and provide a seamless user experience.

**Code Reusability** - The SDK should promote code reusability, allowing developers to write their code once and use it across multiple parts of their application or even across different projects.

**Modularity** - The SDK should be modular, allowing developers to include only the components they need, which can reduce the complexity and size of the applications.

**Continuous Validation** - The SDK should include tools for continuous testing and validation, helping developers to catch issues early and maintain high-quality code throughout the development process.
