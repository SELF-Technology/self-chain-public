# Super-App & SELF Chain Testnet

The Super-App will run on the SELF Chain Testnet and each user's profile will be an individual node on the network, running their own private AI. The initial features will be:

**SELF AI** - An advanced system that learns about you and generates a unique user profile, enriching your AI experience with persistent memory.

**SELF Browser** - With a built-in VPN, the SELF Browser is your personal web access. Access SELF AI, personalisation features and SELF chain directly from the browser.

**SELF Messenger** - Node-to-node messaging, meaning it's only you and the receiver involved. Use your own SELF directly in the chat to plan things to do together.

**SELF Rewards** - Earn SELF currency by using the service, and helping to secure the network.

**SELF Wallet** - Store your SELF currency, other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, enabling you to send, receive and convert.

**SELF Experience** - No intrusive ads, no interruptions from businesses stealing your attention or information.

After the above has been established and the Super-App is in App Stores, we will begin Phase 2 with the developer outreach and SDK.
