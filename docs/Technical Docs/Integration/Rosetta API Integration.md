# Rosetta API Integration

## Overview

SELF Chain implements the Rosetta API standard to ensure compatibility with major cryptocurrency exchanges and infrastructure providers, including Coinbase. This integration enables exchanges to interact with SELF Chain's revolutionary Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus through a standardized interface.

## Purpose

The Rosetta API integration serves critical functions for SELF Chain:

1. **Exchange Compatibility**: Enable listing on major exchanges like Coinbase
2. **Native SELF Coin Support**: Direct integration for the native SELF coin (not just ERC-20 tokens)
3. **PoAI Transparency**: Expose PoAI consensus operations through standard APIs
4. **Ecosystem Growth**: Facilitate adoption by reducing integration complexity

## PoAI Consensus Integration

### How Rosetta Works with PoAI

The Rosetta API translates SELF Chain's unique PoAI operations into standard blockchain operations:

1. **Block Production**
   - AI-Block Builders create blocks through PoAI consensus
   - Rosetta API exposes these as standard block endpoints
   - Block metadata includes PoAI validation scores

2. **Transaction Validation**
   - AI-Validators verify transactions using color marker system
   - Rosetta represents this as standard transaction status
   - Validation proofs accessible through construction endpoints

3. **Consensus Representation**
   - PoAI voting results mapped to block finality status
   - AI validator decisions exposed as block metadata
   - Color marker transitions tracked in account states

## API Implementation

### Core Endpoints

```javascript
// Network Endpoints
/network/list        - Returns SELF Chain network information
/network/status      - Current PoAI consensus status
/network/options     - Supported PoAI operations

// Data Endpoints  
/block               - Block data with PoAI metadata
/block/transaction   - Transaction with AI validation status
/account/balance     - Account balance with color marker state
/account/coins       - UTXO set for native SELF coins

// Construction Endpoints (for exchanges)
/construction/derive    - Derive addresses for SELF Chain
/construction/preprocess - Prepare PoAI-compatible transactions
/construction/metadata   - Get PoAI validation requirements
/construction/payloads   - Create transaction payloads
/construction/combine    - Combine signatures
/construction/submit     - Submit to PoAI consensus
```

### PoAI-Specific Extensions

```javascript
// Custom metadata in responses
{
  "block": {
    "block_identifier": {...},
    "parent_block_identifier": {...},
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "transactions": [...],
    "metadata": {
      "poai_validation": {
        "ai_validator": "validator_001",
        "validation_score": 0.99,
        "color_marker_root": "0xabc123...",
        "consensus_type": "unanimous"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Network Configuration

### SELF Chain Parameters

```javascript
{
  "network_identifier": {
    "blockchain": "SELF",
    "network": "mainnet"
  },
  "genesis_block_identifier": {
    "index": 0,
    "hash": "0xGENESIS_HASH"
  },
  "oldest_block_identifier": {
    "index": 0,
    "hash": "0xGENESIS_HASH"
  },
  "sync_status": {
    "synced": true,
    "current_index": 1234567
  },
  "peers": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "consensus": "Proof-of-AI (PoAI)",
    "native_token": "SELF",
    "target_tps": 50000,
    "ai_validators_active": 100
  }
}
```

### Performance Specifications

- **Target TPS**: 50,000 transactions per second
- **Block Time**: ~1-2 seconds (AI-optimized)
- **Finality**: Instant with PoAI consensus
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for data queries

## Exchange Integration Guide

### For Native SELF Coin

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Configure Rosetta client for SELF Chain
   rosetta-cli config:create self-mainnet.json
   ```

2. **Network Detection**
   - Use `/network/list` to discover SELF Chain
   - Verify consensus type is "Proof-of-AI"
   - Confirm native token is "SELF"

3. **Balance Tracking**
   - Monitor color marker states for accurate balances
   - Track AI validation scores for transaction confidence
   - Use construction API for exchange operations

### Migration from ERC-20

While SELF may initially launch as an ERC-20 token for accessibility, the Rosetta API ensures smooth transition to the native SELF coin on the PoAI-powered mainnet:

1. **Dual Support Period**
   - ERC-20 SELF tokens on Ethereum
   - Native SELF coins on SELF Chain
   - Bridge service for conversion

2. **Exchange Migration**
   - Rosetta API remains consistent
   - Only network identifier changes
   - Same integration codebase

## Security Considerations

### PoAI Security Features

1. **AI Validation**
   - Every transaction validated by multiple AI models
   - Color marker system prevents double-spending
   - Real-time threat detection

2. **Exchange Protection**
   - Built-in rate limiting
   - AI-powered anomaly detection
   - Automatic threat mitigation

3. **API Security**
   - TLS 1.3 encryption required
   - API key authentication for write operations
   - Request signing for construction endpoints

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Available Metrics

```javascript
// PoAI Consensus Metrics
- ai_validators_active
- consensus_rounds_per_second
