- Network bandwidth

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Sharding
```rust
struct ShardingManager {
    config: ShardingConfig,
    shards: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Shard>>>,
    rebalance_interval: tokio::time::Interval,
}
```

### Benchmarking
```rust
struct BenchmarkSuite {
    config: BenchmarkConfig,
    metrics: Arc<RwLock<BenchmarkMetrics>>,
    grid_compute: Arc<GridCompute>,
    performance_monitor: Arc<PerformanceMonitor>,
}
```

## Performance Targets
- Target TPS: 50,000+ transactions per second (design goal)
- Peak TPS Target: 100,000+ transactions per second (theoretical maximum)
- Target Average Latency: < 1ms (under optimal conditions)
- Target Network Latency: < 10ms (datacenter environments)
- Memory Usage: Optimization in progress
- Target CPU Utilization: < 90% (at full load)
- Target GPU Utilization: < 90% (when GPU acceleration enabled)

## Benchmarking Scenarios
