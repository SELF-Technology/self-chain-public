# Cloud Architecture Overview

## Every User Gets Their Own Private Cloud

SELF Chain provides each user with their own isolated cloud instance, ensuring complete data sovereignty and privacy. When you sign up through the SELF Super-App, we automatically provision dedicated cloud resources just for you.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **User Sovereignty**
- Your data never leaves your instance
- Your AI model is completely private
- No shared resources between users
- Full control over your digital life

### 2. **Automatic Provisioning**
- Sign up in the Super-App
- Cloud resources provisioned in < 30 seconds
- No technical knowledge required
- Instant access to your private AI assistant

### 3. **Resource Isolation**
- Dedicated compute resources
- Isolated storage
- Private networking
- Secure boundaries between users

## What's Included in Your Cloud Instance

Each user's private cloud includes:

### SELF Chain Node
- Participates in the blockchain network
- Validates transactions using Proof-of-AI (PoAI)
- Stores your personal data securely
- Manages your digital identity

### Private LLM (Large Language Model)
- Your own AI assistant that learns from you
- Complete privacy - conversations never leave your instance
- Customizable based on your preferences
- No data sharing with other users or SELF

### Decentralized Storage
- OrbitDB for distributed data
- IPFS for content addressing
- Encrypted personal storage
- Automatic backups

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Track your resource usage (Shine %)
- Performance metrics
- Health monitoring
- Usage insights

## Migration Path

As you grow, seamlessly upgrade your resources:

1. **Monitor Usage**: Track your Shine % in the app
2. **Upgrade Notification**: Get alerted when you're reaching limits
3. **One-Click Upgrade**: Upgrade tier without downtime
4. **Instant Resources**: Additional resources available immediately

## Developer Integration

### API Access
Developers can integrate with the provisioning system:

```javascript
// Example: Provision a new user instance
const response = await selfChain.provision({
  userId: 'user123',
  tier: 'free',
  region: 'us-east'
});

// Returns
{
  success: true,
  instanceId: 'inst_abc123',
  endpoints: {
    api: 'https://user123.api.self.app',
    websocket: 'wss://user123.ws.self.app'
  }
}
```

### Webhooks
Get notified of provisioning events:
- `instance.created`
- `instance.upgraded`
- `instance.suspended`
- `instance.deleted`

### SDKs Available
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust

## Future Enhancements
