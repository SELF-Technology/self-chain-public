# The Incentive

The reward for participation is generated as a native coin, earned by helping to assemble a new block among participants in the consensus process. An example reward distribution is as follows:

* 90% goes to the block builder;
* 8% is distributed among the AI validators who voted for the winning block builder;
* 1% goes to the AI validator, who double-checked the block (according to the color scheme);
* 1% of the reward goes to PoAI mechanisms (credited to the blockchain's reserve fund) for organising the voting procedure.

These percentages can be revised to reflect each consensus participant's labor costs and contribution to its implementation. The example above is illustrated below:
