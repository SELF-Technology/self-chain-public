# PoAI Taxonomy

This document defines the core terminology and data structures used in the Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus mechanism. Understanding these components is essential for implementing and interacting with SELF Chain's AI-driven validation system.

## Core Components

### Validation Data Structures

#### HEX Wallet
Every wallet on SELF Chain contains a unique color attribute represented as a hexadecimal value. This color serves as a primary identifier for AI validators during the validation process. When transactions are signed, they generate hexadecimal hashes that are processed by the PoAI mechanism.

#### HEX Transaction
Transaction hashes are divided into six distinct parts and processed to create a single hexadecimal number. This standardized format enables AI validators to efficiently process and validate transactions using color-based pattern recognition.

#### Color Markers
Dynamic visual identifiers used by AI validators to connect blocks to the blockchain. These markers change based on transaction processing patterns and serve as the primary validation mechanism for ensuring blockchain integrity.

### Block Building Components

#### Reference Block
The optimal block generated by the PoAI mechanism that serves as the comparison standard. All block builder submissions are evaluated against this reference to determine their efficiency and quality.

#### Efficiency Coefficient
A numeric measurement representing the quality of a proposed block. Calculated as the percentage of the block filled with useful transaction data (Input minus Output), this coefficient determines which block builder wins the right to add their block to the chain.

#### Mempool
The transaction pool from which both the PoAI mechanism and block builders select transactions. The AI algorithms analyze mempool contents to construct the most efficient blocks possible.

### Network Participants

#### Lite Nodes
Blockchain nodes that maintain wallet addresses and color markers without storing the full blockchain state. These nodes can send and receive transactions while contributing to network decentralization.

#### AI Validators
Automated validators that use the AI-Validator Algorithm to vote on block proposals and verify color scheme integrity. Selected randomly from active network participants meeting minimum requirements.

#### Block Builders
Nodes running the AI-Block Builder Algorithm to create efficient transaction blocks. They compete by submitting blocks with the highest efficiency coefficients compared to the reference block.

## Consensus Mechanisms

### Voting Algorithm
The core mechanism that orchestrates communication between AI algorithms and achieves consensus. It manages the selection process for both block builders and validators while ensuring fair distribution of rewards.

### Validation Process
A multi-step process involving:
1. Transaction color analysis using HEX values
2. Block efficiency comparison against the reference
3. Validator voting on proposed blocks
4. Color scheme verification for final approval

### Timeout Period
Successful block builders enter a cooldown period of N blocks before they can participate again. This mechanism ensures fair opportunity distribution across all network participants.

## Reward Structure

The PoAI system distributes rewards to maintain network security and incentivize participation:

- **Block Builder**: 90% of block rewards for successful block creation
- **AI Validators (Voters)**: 8% distributed among validators who voted correctly
- **AI Validator (Color Checker)**: 1% for the validator performing color scheme verification
- **PoAI Reserve Fund**: 1% allocated for system maintenance and development

## Efficiency Metrics

### Points Volume Maximization
Blocks are optimized to contain the maximum possible volume of Points (the native utility token), ensuring efficient use of block space and maximizing network throughput.

### PointPrice Stability
The AI algorithms work to maintain stable PointPrice across blocks, preventing dramatic fluctuations and ensuring predictable transaction costs for network users.

## Validator Requirements

To participate as an AI validator, nodes must meet specific criteria:

- **Active Wallet**: Must have processed transactions within the last N hours
- **Minimum Balance**: Maintain a minimum amount of native currency
- **Availability**: Be online and responsive during the validation window
- **Random Selection**: Accept the randomized selection process for fair participation

This taxonomy forms the foundation for understanding how PoAI achieves decentralized consensus through AI-driven efficiency, removing human interference while maintaining security and fairness across the network.
