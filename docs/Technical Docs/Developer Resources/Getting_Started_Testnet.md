# Getting Started with SELF Chain (Testnet)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **TESTNET WARNING**: SELF Chain is currently in testnet phase. Do not use real assets or deploy production applications. Testnet tokens have no value and the network may be reset at any time.

## Welcome Developers!

Welcome to SELF Chain - a revolutionary blockchain powered by Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus. This guide will help you start building on our testnet.

## üöß Current Testnet Status

- **Phase**: Active Testnet
- **Network**: May be reset periodically
- **Tokens**: Test tokens only (no real value)
- **Stability**: Expect occasional disruptions
- **Features**: Core functionality available, some features in development

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Rust** 1.70 or higher
- **Node.js** 18 or higher  
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

## Quick Start (Testnet)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public.git
cd self-chain-public
```

### 2. Set Up Testnet Configuration

Create a testnet configuration file:

```bash
cp config/testnet.example.toml config/testnet.toml
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never use mainnet keys or real funds on testnet!

### 3. Get Testnet Tokens

Testnet tokens are available from our faucet:

```bash
# Coming soon - Discord faucet bot
# Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/WdMdVpA4C8
# Use command: !faucet <your_testnet_address>
```

### 4. Connect to Testnet

```javascript
// Example connection (JavaScript SDK - coming soon)
const { SELFClient } = require('@self-chain/sdk');

const client = new SELFClient({
  network: 'testnet',
  endpoint: 'https://testnet-api.self.app',
  // WARNING: This is a testnet endpoint - do not send real assets!
});
```

## Understanding PoAI Consensus

SELF Chain uses Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus, which is fundamentally different from traditional blockchains:

1. **AI-Block Builders** create optimal blocks
2. **Voting Algorithm** coordinates consensus
3. **AI-Validators** determine the winning block

Learn more: [Proof-of-AI Documentation](Technical%20Docs/PoAI/Proof-of-AI.md)

## Testnet Limitations

### What You CAN Do on Testnet:
- ‚úÖ Test smart contracts
- ‚úÖ Experiment with PoAI consensus
- ‚úÖ Build and test dApps
- ‚úÖ Report bugs and issues
- ‚úÖ Learn the SELF Chain architecture

### What You CANNOT Do on Testnet:
- ‚ùå Use real cryptocurrency
- ‚ùå Deploy production applications
- ‚ùå Expect persistent data (resets may occur)
- ‚ùå Rely on uptime guarantees
- ‚ùå Transfer testnet tokens to mainnet

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development

For local testing without connecting to testnet:

```bash
# Start local development node
cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --dev

# This runs a local instance with:
# - Instant block production
# - Pre-funded test accounts
# - No real PoAI consensus (simplified for development)
```

### 2. Testnet Deployment

When ready to test on the actual testnet:

```bash
# Build your application
cargo build --release

# Deploy to testnet (example)
self-chain-cli deploy --network testnet --contract ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm
```

### 3. Monitoring Your Application

```bash
# Check transaction status
self-chain-cli tx status <tx_hash> --network testnet

# Monitor blocks
self-chain-cli blocks watch --network testnet
```

## Available Tools & Resources

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
```bash
# Install CLI
cargo install self-chain-cli

# View available commands
self-chain-cli --help
```

### SDKs (Coming Soon)
- **Rust SDK**: Native Rust integration
- **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**: For web developers
- **Python SDK**: For data scientists and researchers
- **Go SDK**: For backend services

### Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](Architecture/SELF_Chain_Architecture.md)
- [PoAI Consensus](Technical%20Docs/PoAI/Proof-of-AI.md)
- [API Reference](https://testnet-api.self.app/docs) (Testnet)

## Common Testnet Issues

### Connection Problems
```bash
# Check testnet status
curl https://testnet-api.self.app/status

# Expected response:
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "status": "operational",
  "block_height": 12345,
  "warning": "This is a test network - do not use real assets"
}
```

### Faucet Issues
- Faucet limits: 100 TEST tokens per day per address
- If faucet is empty, notify us on Discord
- Test tokens have NO value

### Network Resets
- Announced 48 hours in advance on Discord
- All testnet data will be wiped
- New genesis block created

## Security Considerations for Testnet

Even on testnet, follow security best practices:

1. **Never share private keys** - even testnet keys
2. **Don't reuse passwords** from other services
3. **Report vulnerabilities** to security@self.app
4. **Test edge cases** - help us find bugs!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **This is a TESTNET** - Not for production use
2. **Test tokens have NO VALUE** - Never buy/sell them
3. **Network may reset** - Don't store important data
4. **Expect bugs** - Report them to help us improve
5. **Have fun experimenting** - That's what testnet is for!

## Next Steps
