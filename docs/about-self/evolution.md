# The Evolution Of Technology

Technology is evolving in two main directions; towards more centralized control, or towards decentralized, democratic, user-control. Humanity is at a crossroads and everyone has a choice:

* Should we continue to use solutions that contribute to manifesting a future in which centralized forces dominate through power and influence,  where humans are data batteries and our rights are subjective?

* Or should we choose solutions that empower individuals to have ownership and control over their digital experiences and their data?

This will increasingly become a consequential choice as the capabilities of AI evolve and the data that platforms and their partners collect on us increases exponentially. Here's a short video explaining this point in more detail:

# Shifting of the Overton Window

The operating systems of the world we live in today provide access to a technological environment where the user receives something valuable - the ability to utilize a vast selection of free and paid applications. In return for this ability, people pay for a license and sacrifice a significant portion of their personal data to technology companies. Anyone using these systems and their applications are also at the mercy of social media algorithms that ultimately set the parameters for creating the filter bubbles the user inevitably ends up in.

Many accept this without much thought, perhaps due to not realizing what's really happening, sheer convenience, or because there isn't a functioning or efficient alternative. Some may be fully aware of whatâ€™s going on, but feel that surrendering personal privacy and the rights to their own data in return for a free social media app is fair. One could view this as a shifting "Overton Window" (a concept outlined in the video at the base of this page). When something starts as unthinkable and then becomes considered radical, acceptable, and sensible before it finally establishes itself as the popular norm. Anyone with a passing interest in politics may recognize this phenomenon.

Itâ€™s hard to imagine the situation will change anytime soon. Most will continue to choose the large platforms because thatâ€™s what everyone else is doing, and the perceived benefits gained from using those systems appear to outweigh the data ownership and information control handed over.

Still, we suspect that a growing number of people want something different. Just by observing the explosive growth of interest in blockchain technology, privacy tools and decentralized solutions over the past decade, it's possible to deduce that a percentage of the population would prefer to use a platform that is democratic and private, provided that it is valuable, efficient and easy to use; either as an addition to or instead of, current platforms.
