# üèõÔ∏è DAO Governance

SELF Studio is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where developers, users, and contributors participate in decision-making and shape the future of software development.

> Membership: The first **100,000** paid subscribers (Protostars) form the initial SELF DAO. Voting rights require an active subscription; churned seats are automatically replaced by the next eligible user in the queue.

## üåç What is SELF DAO?

SELF DAO represents a fundamental shift in how technology is built and governed. Instead of decisions being made behind closed doors by corporations, the community collectively determines SELF Studio's evolution, features, and direction.

### **Core Principles**

- **üèõÔ∏è Community Ownership**: No single entity controls SELF Studio - it belongs to everyone who contributes
- **üó≥Ô∏è Democratic Decision Making**: Every voice matters in shaping the future of development
- **üåç Global Participation**: Developers worldwide can influence the tools they use daily
- **üîí Transparent Governance**: All decisions are open and verifiable by the community
- **ü§ù Collaborative Development**: Build together, decide together, succeed together

## üí≠ The Vision

**Imagine a world where:**

- Developers have true ownership over their development tools
- The most innovative ideas rise to the top through community consensus
- Technology serves humanity rather than corporate interests
- Every contributor has a voice in the ecosystem they help build
- Innovation happens at the speed of collective imagination

## üåü How the DAO Works

### **Community-Driven Decisions**

The SELF DAO makes decisions about:

- **New Features**: What capabilities should SELF Studio gain next?
- **App Approval**: Which community-built applications deserve recognition and support?
- **Platform Direction**: How should the ecosystem evolve to best serve developers?
- **Community Standards**: What values and practices define our shared culture?

### **Treasury Authority**
- User Adoption Pool (75M SELF): feature prioritization, dev resourcing, community rewards
- Developer Incentives Pool (75M SELF): SELF Studio app funding, SELF Store approvals, builder rewards

### **Proposal Lifecycle (Spec)**
1. Draft submission (public forum + spec template)
2. Founder/maintainer shortlist for feasibility and scope
3. On-chain/off-chain signaling (TBD) and formal vote
4. Milestone-based execution with transparent reporting
5. Post-mortem and learnings archive

### **Quorum & Thresholds (TBD)**
- Quorum: proposed X% of eligible Protostar voters
- Passing threshold: proposed simple majority; supermajority for treasury reallocations
- Emergency veto: narrow scope, time-limited, with public justification

### **Conflict of Interest**
- Mandatory disclosure for proposers/beneficiaries
- Recusal rules for direct beneficiaries
- Transparent treasury flows and reporting cadence

### **Democratic Participation**

Every community member can:

- **Propose Ideas**: Submit suggestions for improvements or new directions
- **Vote on Proposals**: Help decide which ideas become reality
- **Contribute Expertise**: Share knowledge and skills to benefit everyone
- **Build Together**: Collaborate on projects that advance the entire ecosystem

## üå± A New Era of Development

SELF DAO represents more than just governance - it's a movement toward:

- **Democratized Technology**: Power in the hands of creators, not corporations
- **Collective Intelligence**: Harnessing the wisdom of the global developer community
- **Sustainable Innovation**: Building for long-term benefit rather than short-term profit
- **Inclusive Progress**: Ensuring technology advancement benefits everyone

## üîÆ The Future We're Building

Through the DAO, we're creating a future where:

- Technology development is truly democratic
- Innovation serves the common good
- Developers have agency over their tools and environment
- Global collaboration replaces corporate competition
- The best ideas win, regardless of their source

*The SELF DAO will launch alongside SELF Studio in Q4 2025. Specific quorum/threshold values and implementation details will be finalized prior to launch and reflected here.*
