# A Self-Sovereign Alternative

An ethically anchored philosophy that puts the user front and centre should be the fundamental basis for designing an operating system of the future. Such a system should not put an excessive focus on monetising its users and their data, but instead give users full control over their information. Users should have data privacy by default and be able to decide what to share and what to keep private.

The goal should be to deliver a user experience of clarity and help the user accomplish things with a positive signal, rather than having to tolerate meaningless noise to just use a service. Various distraction-blocking and ad-blocking mechanisms should be integrated by default and not penalised. The ability for individuals to turn off, pause and take time out, should be paramount. The first part of self-sovereignty is to be in control of the interaction.

An adaptive and hyper-personalised AI should be at the centre of the new operating system, starting its life as a 'Super-App', named as such due to its multi-functional capabilities. The Super-App needs to be on common devices (e.g. iPhone) to ensure people can experience the new paradigm rather than have to change what they're used to. It should be compatible with external applications, but also come with an integrated ecosystem of built-in decentralised applications created by a passionate community of developers. 

As the Super-App eventually matures into an Operating System, the user will gain access to useful tools and functionalities ranging from private messaging and hyper-secure file sharing, through to the more technical such as decentralised storage, decentralised yield farming, borrowing/lending protocols, NFTs, data and compute power marketplaces, investing applications, and cost-efficient fiat onboarding protocols.
