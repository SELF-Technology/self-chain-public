# Competition

This is the way we view competition, including platforms who use similar terminology to us.

* Despite the potential perceptions of some, an offering that is **not** self-sovereign **does not** compete in the same market as SELF. Our target users seek an **alternative** to non-self-sovereign technology, a distinction that significantly sets us apart.

* An offering that promotes self-sovereignty would **benefit us**, as they would be helping to educate the market and widen the reach of self-sovereign technology. The worst case would be for there to be few others in this space. Best case, there is a growing volume of alternatives.

* The market of self-sovereign technology is **yet to be established**, so the "market share" and "market leaders" are yet to appear. And even when they do, the prior points remain salient.

* Our main competition focus is on **the gap between where we are, and our potential**.
