# Operating System

SELF OS will work similarly to a typical operating system in terms of having numerous applications that assist with various tasks, from communication to note-taking and scheduling to purchasing. However, all the innate applications will be linked to one another by each user’s SELF AI, meaning that their individual preferences are part of how the applications work. Any external application that makes such interactions possible will also be integrated. This will enable an entirely new experience of interacting with an operating system.

Typically, using a messaging app is unlinked to what you’re looking to buy. However, on SELF OS, you could exchange messages with your friend to discuss what to buy for tonight’s dinner, and your SELF would be checking where and how to buy those items while discussing them. As another example, if a user wants to use SELF to plan out their upcoming week, the operating system will take what they verbally say and crossmatch that with every application the user has installed on SELF OS. If any applications can assist the user, the applications are triggered in the background by the user’s SELF. The user is then told what tasks are pending completion and which are completed.

The SDK developer community that builds the applications for SELF OS may be part of a DAO that can raise funds to support the development of the applications and the maintenance of the network.

## Hardware Products & Infrastructure

Over time, hardware products will be offered directly or by licensed partners. This may include secure, privacy-conscious, productivity-optimised devices with SELF OS preinstalled. We are [concerned about blue light](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) and its [impact on heatlh](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-blue-light), so we will seek alternatives as a priority.

Depending on the target audience, various models could be available, including a very affordable device with budget specs and no internet access,meant to be used as a productivity-focused word processor with advanced AI capabilities and a workflow system with reward mechanisms, completely avoiding any possibility of getting distracted by the internet. Another could be task-specific devices (e.g., for video editing, designing, writing, producing music, etc.), with specs and prices adapted to what is needed for that task.

Some or all products could have an integrated gamification and reward mechanism for completing tasks, enabling the ecosystem to be circular and self-fulfilling. Literally.

Looking far ahead, expansion possibilities may include satellite internet infrastructure, amongst other innovations. Ultimately, we believe that technology and communication channels should be independent and self-sovereign.
