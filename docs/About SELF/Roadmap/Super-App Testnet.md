# Super-App & SELF Chain Testnet

The Super-App will run on the SELF Chain Testnet and each user's profile will be an individual node on the network, running their own private AI. The initial features will be:

**SELF AI** - An advanced system that learns you, enriching your AI experience with persistent memory.

**SELF Browser** - With a built-in VPN, the SELF Browser is your personal web access without others accessing your data.

**SELF Messenger** - Node-to-node messaging, meaning it's only you and the receiver involved.

**SELF Rewards** - Earn SELF currency by using the service, and helping to secure the network.

**SELF Wallet** - Store your SELF currency and others, enabling you to send, receive and convert.

**SELF Experience** - No intrusive ads, no interruptions from businesses stealing your attention or information.

After the above has been established and the Super-App is in App Stores, we will begin Phase 2 with the developer outreach and SDK.
