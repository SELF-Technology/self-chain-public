# SELF Token

## Leverage Your Data

The ultimate objective of the token is for users to realise and leverage the value of their personal data. This is in direct contrast to the way modern technology tends to operate, where the platforms reap all the benefits and earn more, the more data their users give up.

## Purchase subscriptions and services with a discount

The SELF token will be used to purchase premium subscription to SELF and additional services with a discount.

## Trading Currency within the SELF Ecosystem

As the broader SELF ecosystem develops, the token will be the primary trading currency. This includes purchases, payments, decentralised applications on SELF chain and usage within SELF OS.

## Staking

Lock up tokens as a user or business client to receive a staking APR and possibly discounts, whitelist and airdrops from ecosystem partners and teams building with the SELF SDK (subject to change, TBD).

## Referral Scheme and Points Program

SELF will incentivise activities that are beneficial to the development of the ecosystem via the referral scheme and our in-depth points program. More information to follow soon.

## Buyback Process

The buyback process is where a percentage of SELF's different revenue streams is used to buy the SELF token on exchanges, generating perpetual buy pressure. Of the tokens purchased, the usage will be split as follows:‍

1. Burning (reducing distributed supply)
2. Staking (increasing APR for token holders)
3. Premium subscription rebates (reducing costs or enabling users to spend within the system)

The long-term goal for the SELF token is to become deflationary through such mechanisms.

## Earn Mechanism

One of the core use cases of later versions of the SELF web app, mobile app and browser extension is the Earn mechanism. SELF will establish affiliate partnerships with a large number of companies within a range of industries – ranging from travel, health and beauty to software, entertainment and finance. The list of partners will grow over time, eventually ranging in the thousands.

When the user asks SELF for assistance involving a possible purchase, such as asking for recommendations or requesting a summary review of a product/service, a referral link is included in the reply. Off-chain processes track the purchase made through the link and once payment has been confirmed, an automated purchase of SELF is initiated on a decentralised exchange on behalf of the user, amounting to a significant percentage of the referral commission for that product or service. Some tokens are also burned during this time.

SELF tokens  are credited to the user's wallet once the purchase is confirmed, which is likely to happen quarterly. The tokens will be locked for a certain amount of time to account for refund policies, to prevent users from abusing the system by purchasing something through SELF, selling their SELF tokens, and then requesting a refund of that item or service.

This mechanism creates a perpetual buy pressure on the SELF token which could be very beneficial to the price, although not guaranteed (there are many factors in play that influence the price of a crypto token and this is not financial advice). There will also be various incentives in place for the user to hold on to their SELF tokens instead of selling them.
