# The Long-Term Goal

Over the decades to come, the ultimate goal is to create and maintain a sustainable, aesthetically coherent, secure, privacy-conscious and productivity-optimised operating system that is of tremendous value to the world; simplifying life for individuals and positively impacting industry in the process. This is the SELF Operating System (SELF OS).

SELF OS will be a set of combined applications developed on the SELF Chain by developers building on the SELF SDK. As the SELF Chain has an AI-Powered consensus mechanism [Proof-of-AI](https://docs.self.app/Technical%20Docs/Proof-of-AI), every application has the AI feature set built-in.

Also, SELF Chain will enable a constellation of other blockchains to be developed in parallel, each of which can use their own unique configuration of the AI, and generate their own tokens.

Every industry vertical has the potential to be positively advanced through the efficient and sustainable systems we will offer, using the infrastructure we’re building today and tomorrow. We believe that technological advancements should have a more positive impact on the world than they currently do. Our goal is to demonstrate how, and hopefully inspire others to do the same.

The vision is huge and bold, yet we are confident that we will succeed in making our vision of an ethical, fair, and decentralised powerhouse a reality. Even if it takes longer than we would like, or we only achieve a fraction of our goals, our commitment will not waver. We will have demonstrated an alternative to a dystopican future and will have succeeded if we can achieve even the beginnings of such a demonstration. Future generations can be inspired by the direction and take this vision further. This is just the start.
