## Overview

SELF Chain pioneers the integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a core component of its AI-native blockchain platform. This integration enables developers to build sophisticated applications with built-in AI capabilities while maintaining user privacy and data sovereignty.

## What is SELF MCP?

SELF MCP is our implementation of the Model Context Protocol specifically designed for blockchain development. It provides:

- **Integrated AI Tooling**: Seamless access to AI capabilities within your blockchain applications
- **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Enable AI-powered features without compromising user data
- **Automated Development Workflows**: AI automatically selects and invokes appropriate tools based on context
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central AI server - each user maintains their own AI instance

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```
SELF MCP Architecture
├── MCP Server Layer
│   ├── Tool Orchestration Engine
│   ├── Privacy Control Module
│   └── Cross-App Communication Protocol
├── Integration Layer
│   ├── SDK Bindings
│   ├── Transport Protocols (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
│   └── Security Middleware
└── Application Layer
    ├── Developer Tools
    ├── User Applications
    └── AI Services
```

### How It Works

1. **Tool Registration**: MCP servers register their capabilities with the SELF platform
2. **Context Analysis**: AI analyzes developer intent and application context
3. **Automatic Invocation**: Appropriate tools are automatically selected and invoked
4. **Privacy Preservation**: All operations respect user data sovereignty
5. **Result Integration**: AI responses are seamlessly integrated into the application flow

## Key Features

### 1. Privacy-Preserving AI Collaboration

SELF MCP enables unique collaborative AI features while maintaining complete privacy:

```typescript
// PLANNED API - Example of how privacy-preserving collaboration will work
const collaborationSession = await mcp.createSession({
  type: 'collaborative',
  participants: ['alice.self', 'bob.self'],
  privacy: {
    level: 'maximum',
    dataSharing: 'none',
    temporaryContext: true
  }
});

// Each participant's AI contributes without sharing personal data
const insights = await collaborationSession.analyze({
  task: 'code-review',
  context: sharedCodebase
});
```

### 2. Cross-App AI Coordination

One AI instance can work seamlessly across multiple applications:

```typescript
// PLANNED API - Browser app shares context with messaging app
await mcp.shareContext({
  from: 'browser',
  to: 'messenger',
  data: {
    type: 'research-summary',
    content: webPageAnalysis
  },
  preservePrivacy: true
});
```

### 3. Automated Tool Orchestration

MCP automatically selects the right tools based on context:

```typescript
// PLANNED API - Developer writes naturally, MCP handles tool selection
const result = await mcp.process({
  input: "Analyze this smart contract for security issues",
  context: { code: contractCode }
  // MCP automatically invokes:
  // - Security analysis tools
  // - Documentation lookup
  // - Best practices verification
});
```

### 4. Decentralized Personal AI

Each user maintains their own AI instance with full control:

```typescript
// PLANNED API - Personal AI configuration
const personalAI = await mcp.initializeAI({
  storage: 'local-encrypted',
  memory: 'persistent',
  sharing: 'explicit-consent-only'
});
```

## Developer Integration

### Installation

```bash
# Coming Q4 2025
npm install @self/mcp
```

### Basic Setup

```typescript
// PLANNED API - Basic MCP setup
import { SELFMCP } from '@self/mcp';

const mcp = new SELFMCP({
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  environment: 'testnet',
  aiCapabilities: ['analysis', 'collaboration', 'automation']
});

// Initialize with user consent
await mcp.initialize({
  userConsent: true,
  privacyLevel: 'standard'
});
```

### Advanced Integration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Contextual Development Assistance

```typescript
// MCP provides context-aware development help
const devAssistant = mcp.createAssistant({
  mode: 'development',
  tools: ['security-scanner', 'doc-lookup', 'code-analyzer']
});

// Automatic tool invocation based on code context
devAssistant.on('code-change', async (code) => {
  const analysis = await devAssistant.analyze(code);
  // Returns security issues, optimization suggestions, etc.
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Privacy-First Analytics

```typescript
// Analyze user data without exposing it
const analytics = await mcp.analyzePrivately({
  data: userActivityData,
  aggregation: 'local-only',
  insights: ['patterns', 'recommendations'],
  shareWith: [] // No external sharing
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Community AI Assistance

```typescript
// Enable users to help each other via AI
const helpSession = await mcp.offerHelp({
  helper: currentUser,
  requester: 'user-needing-help.self',
  expertise: 'smart-contract-development',
  compensation: {
    type: 'shine-percentage',
    amount: 10
  }
});
```

## MCP Server Ecosystem

SELF MCP supports integration with various specialized MCP servers:

### Currently Integrated

| MCP Server | Purpose | Use Cases |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Web Intelligence** | Content extraction & analysis | Research, documentation, web scraping |
| **Security Analysis** | Code vulnerability detection | Smart contract auditing, security reviews |
| **Documentation** | API reference & examples | Real-time docs, code examples |
| **Browser Automation** | UI testing & automation | E2E testing, user flow validation |

### Planned Integrations

- **Blockchain Analytics MCP**: On-chain data analysis
- **Identity Verification MCP**: Decentralized identity management
- **Storage Integration MCP**: IPFS and distributed storage
- **DeFi Protocol MCP**: Financial protocol interactions

## Best Practices

### 1. Privacy-First Design

Always design with user privacy as the primary consideration:

```typescript
// Good: Explicit privacy controls
const result = await mcp.process({
  data: sensitiveData,
  privacy: {
    processing: 'local-only',
    retention: 'session',
    sharing: 'none'
  }
});

// Avoid: Unclear data handling
// const result = await mcp.process(sensitiveData);
```

### 2. Efficient Tool Usage

Batch operations and use appropriate caching:

```typescript
// Good: Batch processing
const results = await mcp.batchAnalyze({
  items: codeFiles,
  tools: ['security', 'optimization'],
  cache: true
});

// Avoid: Individual calls in loops
// for (const file of codeFiles) {
//   await mcp.analyze(file);
// }
```

### 3. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for MCP operations:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await mcp.invoke({
    tool: 'security-scanner',
    input: code,
    timeout: 30000
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.type === 'TOOL_UNAVAILABLE') {
    // Fallback to alternative tool or manual process
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Intelligent dApp Development

Developers building decentralized applications can leverage MCP for:
- Automated security auditing during development
- Real-time documentation and code examples
- Intelligent contract optimization suggestions

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Social Platforms

Social applications can enable:
- AI-powered content moderation without viewing user data
- Personalized recommendations computed locally
- Group collaborations with individual privacy

### 3. Decentralized AI Services

Build AI services that:
- Run entirely on user devices
- Collaborate without central coordination
- Monetize assistance through token economics
