```
Your App ↔ SELF MCP Platform (AI + Blockchain + Tools Automatically Orchestrated)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol built directly into the blockchain platform
- **Automated Tool Orchestration**: AI automatically selects and invokes the right tools
- **Privacy-Preserving**: All MCP operations respect user sovereignty and data privacy
- **Cross-App Intelligence**: MCP enables seamless AI coordination across applications

---

## MCP-Powered Development Patterns

### Model Context Protocol Integration

SELF Chain pioneers blockchain-native MCP integration for radically simplified development:

```javascript
// PLANNED API - Shows how SELF MCP integration will work
import { SELFMCP } from '@self/mcp';

const mcp = new SELFMCP({
  appId: process.env.APP_ID,
  mcpServers: {
    // MCP servers are automatically orchestrated
    security: 'semgrep-mcp',
    documentation: 'context7-mcp',
    testing: 'playwright-mcp',
    webAnalysis: 'firecrawl-mcp'
  }
});

// MCP automatically handles complex tasks through context-aware tool selection
const result = await mcp.process({
  input: sourceCode,
  intent: 'security-review',
  // MCP automatically orchestrates:
  // - Security scanning via Semgrep MCP
  // - Documentation lookup via Context7 MCP  
  // - Testing suggestions via Playwright MCP
  // - Web content analysis via Firecrawl MCP
});
```

### MCP-Based Automation Rules

SELF MCP enables intelligent, rule-based automation that understands developer context:

```javascript
// Configure MCP automation rules
const mcpRules = {
  "when URLs detected": "firecrawl-mcp",
  "when security analysis needed": "semgrep-mcp", 
  "when documentation requested": "context7-mcp",
  "when testing mentioned": "playwright-mcp",
  "when web content needed": "firecrawl-mcp"
};

// MCP automatically applies rules without manual tool invocation
const response = await mcp.chat({
  message: "Help me analyze this smart contract for security issues",
  context: { code: contractCode },
  // MCP automatically triggers:
  // - Semgrep MCP for security scanning
  // - Context7 MCP for best practices
  // - Firecrawl MCP for external references
});
```

## AI-Native App Examples

### Intelligent Documentation Assistant

```javascript
class DocumentationAssistant {
  async enhanceDocumentation(session, rawDocs) {
    // AI automatically improves documentation
    const enhanced = await session.ai.analyze({
      content: rawDocs,
      task: 'enhance-documentation',
      // SELF AI tools automatically:
      // - Check for completeness
      // - Add code examples  
      // - Verify API references
      // - Suggest improvements
    });
    
    return enhanced;
  }
}
```

### Privacy-First Analytics

```javascript
class PrivateAnalytics {
  async generateInsights(session, userData) {
    // AI analyzes user data locally
    const insights = await session.ai.analyze({
      data: userData,
      privacy: 'maximum', // Never leaves user's instance
      analysis: ['patterns', 'trends', 'recommendations']
    });
    
    // Only anonymized insights can be shared
    return insights.anonymized;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for AI-Native Development

### 1. Respect AI Resource Usage
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Excessive AI calls
for (let item of largeDataset) {
  await session.ai.analyze(item); // Wasteful
}

// ✅ GOOD: Batch AI operations
const batchAnalysis = await session.ai.analyzeBatch({
  items: largeDataset,
  batchSize: 50
});
```

### 2. Leverage Automatic Tool Selection
```javascript
// ❌ Manual tool management
const securityResult = await selfSecurityTools.analyze(code);
const docsResult = await selfDocTools.lookup(api);

// ✅ Let AI choose appropriate tools
const result = await session.ai.analyze({
  code: code,
  // AI automatically selects and coordinates tools
});
```

### 3. Design for Privacy-Preserving Collaboration
```javascript
// ✅ Enable collaboration without compromising privacy
const helpSession = await session.ai.offerHelp({
  targetUser: 'colleague.self',
  helpType: 'code-review',
  privacy: 'strict' // No personal context shared
});
```
