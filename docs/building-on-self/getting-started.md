# Getting Started

:::warning TESTNET ONLY
**SELF Chain is currently in testnet phase.** 
- Do not use real assets or deploy production applications
- Testnet tokens have ZERO monetary value
- Network may reset at any time without notice
- All data is temporary and will be lost
:::

:::info Development Status
These developer resources are in beta. Many features are still being developed. See [Project Status](/project-status) for current capabilities.

## Welcome to AI-Native Blockchain Development!

SELF Chain isn't just another blockchain - it's the **world's first AI-native blockchain platform**. Built from the ground up with Proof-of-AI consensus, SELF radically simplifies blockchain development by making AI integration a core feature, not an afterthought.

### ü§ñ Why SELF is Different

**AI-Native by Design:**
- **Proof-of-AI Consensus**: AI validators and block builders ensure optimal network performance
- **Built-in Intelligence**: Every transaction benefits from AI validation and optimization
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Native integration of AI tools and services directly into the blockchain platform

**For Developers, This Means:**
- Focus on building great applications, not managing blockchain complexity
- Native AI capabilities through MCP - no third-party integrations needed
- Privacy-preserving AI that works across your entire application ecosystem
- Automatic tool orchestration that understands your development context

### üöÄ MCP: AI-Native Development

SELF Chain's Model Context Protocol integration revolutionizes blockchain development:

**Automated Intelligence:**
- **Smart Tool Selection**: AI automatically invokes the right tools based on your code and context
- **Security-First**: Real-time vulnerability detection and security analysis built into the development flow
- **Living Documentation**: Context-aware API references and code examples that update as you work
- **Privacy by Design**: All AI operations respect user sovereignty and data privacy

**Example MCP Workflow:**
```typescript
// Coming Q4 2025 - Example of MCP in action
import { SELFMCP } from '@self/mcp';

const mcp = new SELFMCP({ appId: 'your-app-id' });

// Write naturally - MCP handles complexity
const result = await mcp.develop({
  task: "Create a secure token transfer function",
  // MCP automatically:
  // - Generates secure code patterns
  // - Runs security analysis
  // - Provides optimization suggestions
  // - Ensures best practices
});
```

## üöß Current Testnet Status

- **Phase**: Active Testnet (Internal Testing)
- **Network**: Resets frequently for testing
- **Tokens**: Test tokens only - ZERO monetary value
- **Stability**: Expect disruptions and downtime
- **Features**: Limited functionality - see [Project Status](/project-status)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18 or higher (for future SDK usage)
- **Git** (for version control)
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

## Why SELF's AI-Native Development Will Be Revolutionary

While you wait, understand what makes SELF different from every other blockchain platform:

### **Traditional Blockchain Development Pain Points:**
- Complex infrastructure setup
- Manual security auditing
- Fragmented tooling
- Steep learning curves
- No built-in intelligence

### **SELF's AI-Native Solution:**
- **Zero Infrastructure Setup**: AI handles complexity
- **Built-in Security**: Real-time vulnerability detection
- **Integrated Tooling**: Everything works together seamlessly  
- **Intelligent Assistance**: AI guides development process
- **Cross-App Coordination**: Apps work together intelligently

### **Revolutionary Use Cases You'll Build:**

**ü§ñ Intelligent Personal Assistants**
Your users' AI learns their preferences and helps across all their apps - calendar, messaging, finance, health - while keeping data completely private.

**üîí Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**
Teams can collaborate using AI without anyone's personal data leaving their control. Revolutionary for enterprise and creative projects.

**üåê Self-Sovereign Web Services**
Build applications where users truly own their data and AI, creating new business models based on user empowerment rather than data extraction.

**üí° AI-Enhanced Everything**
Every blockchain interaction becomes intelligent - transactions optimize themselves, security scans happen automatically, and user experiences adapt in real-time.

## Testnet Limitations

### What You CAN Do on Testnet:
- ‚úÖ Test smart contracts
- ‚úÖ Experiment with PoAI consensus
- ‚úÖ Build and test dApps
- ‚úÖ Report bugs and issues
- ‚úÖ Learn the SELF Chain architecture

### What You CANNOT Do on Testnet:
- ‚ùå Use real cryptocurrency
- ‚ùå Deploy production applications
- ‚ùå Expect persistent data (resets may occur)
- ‚ùå Rely on uptime guarantees
- ‚ùå Transfer testnet tokens to mainnet

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development

For local testing without connecting to testnet:

```bash
# Start local development node
cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --dev

# This runs a local instance with:
# - Instant block production
# - Pre-funded test accounts
# - No real PoAI consensus (simplified for development)
```

### 2. Testnet Deployment

When ready to test on the actual testnet:

```bash
# Build your application
cargo build --release

# Deploy to testnet (example)
self-chain-cli deploy --network testnet --contract ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm
```

### 3. Monitoring Your Application

```bash
# Check transaction status
self-chain-cli tx status <tx_hash> --network testnet

# Monitor blocks
self-chain-cli blocks watch --network testnet
```

## Available Tools & Resources

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
```bash
# Install CLI
cargo install self-chain-cli

# View available commands
self-chain-cli --help
```

### SDKs (Coming Soon)
- **Rust SDK**: Native Rust integration
- **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**: For web developers
- **Python SDK**: For data scientists and researchers
- **Go SDK**: For backend services

### Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](/technical-docs/self-chain/SELF_Chain_Architecture)
- [PoAI Consensus](/technical-docs/PoAI/Proof-of-AI)
- API Reference (Coming soon)

## Common Testnet Issues

### Connection Problems
```bash
# Check testnet status (Coming soon)
# curl https://testnet-api.self.app/status

# Expected response:
# {
#   "network": "testnet",
#   "status": "operational",
#   "block_height": 12345,
#   "warning": "This is a test network - do not use real assets"
# }
```

### Faucet Issues (When Available)
- Planned faucet limits: 100 TEST tokens per day per address
- Support channels: GitHub Issues, Discord, Email (devs@self.app)
- Test tokens have NO value

### Network Resets
- Will be announced via:
  - GitHub Releases
  - Discord community
  - Social media channels
- 48 hours advance notice
- All testnet data will be wiped
- New genesis block created

## Security Considerations for Testnet

Even on testnet, follow security best practices:

1. **Never share private keys** - even testnet keys
2. **Don't reuse passwords** from other services
3. **Report vulnerabilities** to security@self.app
4. **Test edge cases** - help us find bugs!
