# Developer Guide Overview

Welcome to the developer guide for building applications on SELF Chain! This section covers everything you need to know about creating AI-native apps that harness SELF's revolutionary blockchain platform powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## üöÄ Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

SELF Chain is pioneering blockchain-native MCP integration, enabling developers to build applications with:
- **Automated AI Tool Orchestration**: AI automatically selects and invokes the right development tools
- **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Users can help each other through AI without sharing personal data
- **Decentralized Personal AI**: No central AI server - each user controls their own AI instance
- **Cross-App Intelligence**: One AI working seamlessly across all applications
