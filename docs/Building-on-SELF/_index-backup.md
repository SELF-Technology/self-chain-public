# Building on SELF Chain

Welcome to the developer guide for building applications on SELF Chain! This section covers everything you need to know about creating apps that interact with SELF's infrastructure and user instances.

## üéØ What You'll Build

Applications on SELF Chain can:
- **Access User AI**: Integrate with users' private AI instances (with permission)
- **Utilize Secure Storage**: Store and retrieve data from users' encrypted storage
- **Create Privacy-First Apps**: Build experiences that respect user data sovereignty
- **Leverage Cloud Infrastructure**: Use SELF's auto-provisioned infrastructure
