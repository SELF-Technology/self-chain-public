# SELF Token Overview

## Leverage Your Data

The ultimate objective of the token is for users to realise and leverage the value of their personal data. This is in direct contrast to the way modern technology tends to operate, where the platforms reap all the benefits and earn more, the more data their users give up.

## Purchase subscriptions and services with a discount

The SELF token will be used to purchase premium subscription to SELF and additional services with a discount.

## Trading Currency within the SELF Ecosystem

As the broader SELF ecosystem develops, the token will be the primary trading currency. This includes purchases, payments, decentralised applications on SELF chain and usage within SELF OS.

## Staking

Lock up tokens as a user or business client to receive a staking APR and possibly discounts, whitelist and airdrops from ecosystem partners and teams building with the SELF SDK (subject to change, TBD).

## Referral Scheme and Points Program

SELF will incentivise activities that are beneficial to the development of the ecosystem via the referral scheme and our in-depth points program. More information to follow soon.

## Buyback Process

The buyback process is where a percentage of SELF's different revenue streams is used to buy the SELF token on exchanges, generating perpetual buy pressure. Of the tokens purchased, the usage will be split as follows:‚Äç

1. Burning (reducing distributed supply)
2. Staking (increasing APR for token holders)
3. Premium subscription rebates (reducing costs or enabling users to spend within the system)

The long-term goal for the SELF token is to become deflationary through such mechanisms.

## Earn Mechanism

One of the core use cases of later versions of the SELF web app, mobile app and browser extension is the Earn mechanism. SELF will establish affiliate partnerships with a large number of companies within a range of industries ‚Äì ranging from travel, health and beauty to software, entertainment and finance. The list of partners will grow over time, eventually ranging in the thousands.

When the user asks SELF for assistance involving a possible purchase, such as asking for recommendations or requesting a summary review of a product/service, a referral link is included in the reply. Off-chain processes track the purchase made through the link and once payment has been confirmed, an automated purchase of SELF is initiated on a decentralised exchange on behalf of the user, amounting to a significant percentage of the referral commission for that product or service. Some tokens are also burned during this time.

SELF tokens  are credited to the user's wallet once the purchase is confirmed, which is likely to happen quarterly. The tokens will be locked for a certain amount of time to account for refund policies, to prevent users from abusing the system by purchasing something through SELF, selling their SELF tokens, and then requesting a refund of that item or service.

This mechanism creates a perpetual buy pressure on the SELF token which could be very beneficial to the price, although not guaranteed (there are many factors in play that influence the price of a crypto token and this is not financial advice). There will also be various incentives in place for the user to hold on to their SELF tokens instead of selling them.

# üíé SELF Token-Based Subscription Model

## Overview

SELF Chain implements a revolutionary token-based subscription model that aligns with our decentralized vision and creates stronger community incentives. Instead of traditional credit card payments, users stake SELF tokens to access different service tiers.

## üåü Subscription Tiers

### Tier Structure & Pricing

| Tier | Token Value | Monthly Benefits | Target Users |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Free Tier** üí´ | $0 | 100 minutes AI, basic features, 100% Shine to start | New users exploring SELF |
| **Star Tier** ‚≠ê | $15 worth of SELF | 2GB data/compute, priority AI, faster responses | Privacy seekers (70% of users) |
| **Galaxy Tier** üåå | $50 worth of SELF | 10GB data/compute, advanced AI models, SDK access | Power users & developers (25%) |
| **Universe Tier** ü™ê | $150 worth of SELF | 50GB data/compute, unlimited AI, beta features | Web3 pioneers (5%) |
| **Multiverse Tier** üå† | $10K+ staked | Cross-Constellation access, enterprise features | Enterprise power users |

### Dynamic Token Pricing

Since SELF is not a stablecoin, subscription tiers are priced in USD equivalent:
- Users purchase **$X worth** of SELF tokens, not a fixed token amount
- Real-time price feeds determine exact token quantity at purchase time
- Example: "Star Tier: $15/month (currently ~X.XX SELF tokens)"

## üìä Key Concepts

### Shine % System

**Shine %** represents your monthly usage allowance:
- **Always starts at 100%** each billing cycle for all tiers
- **Depletes based on usage** (not time):
  - AI conversations: ~1% per extended session
  - VPN browsing: ~0.5% per GB
  - Messaging: ~0.1% per message
  - Wallet transactions: ~0.2% per transaction
- **When Shine reaches 0%**, service pauses until next billing cycle or tier upgrade

### Subscription Tiers vs Shine %
- **Tier** = Your usage limits before Shine depletes
- **Shine %** = How much of your monthly allowance remains
- Higher tiers have the same 100% Shine but it depletes more slowly

## üîÑ Token Utility Model

### Staking Model (Preferred)
- **Stake tokens for tier access** (don't spend them)
- **Tokens remain in your wallet**, providing ongoing utility
- **Unstaking downgrades tier** after current period
- **Earn staking rewards** while subscribed

### Circular Economy
1. **Run node** ‚Üí Earn SELF tokens
2. **Use tokens** ‚Üí Upgrade subscription tier
3. **Higher tier** ‚Üí Access more features
4. **More usage** ‚Üí Greater network participation

## üåå Multiverse Tier - Cross-Constellation Access

The Multiverse Tier represents the pinnacle of individual SELF Chain participation, granting premium access across the entire Constellation ecosystem.

### Understanding the Constellation
- **Constellation Partners**: Enterprise organizations (Fortune 500, governments) that launch their own L1 chains
- **Constellation Chains**: Sovereign L1 blockchains created by partners
- **Multiverse Subscribers**: Individual power users with access across ALL Constellation Chains

### Core Multiverse Features
- **Universal Chain Access**: Use one identity across every Constellation Chain
- **Cross-Chain Compute Credits**: Your staked tokens provide compute on any chain
- **Unlimited Multi-Chain Shine %**: No usage limits across the entire ecosystem
- **Portfolio Dashboard**: Monitor all your cross-chain activities
- **Priority Bridge Access**: Fast inter-chain transfers and communications
- **Early Access Program**: First to use newly launched Constellation Chains
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Voting power that spans the entire ecosystem
- **Universal AI Access**: Use specialized AI models from any Constellation Chain

### Use Case Examples
A Multiverse subscriber could seamlessly:
1. Execute trades on a Finance Constellation Chain
2. Verify shipments on a Supply Chain Constellation Chain
3. Access medical records on a Healthcare Constellation Chain
4. Vote on governance across multiple chains

All with one subscription, one identity, and instant interoperability.

## üí∞ Benefits Over Traditional Subscriptions

1. **No Geographic Restrictions**: Global access without payment processor limitations
2. **User Investment**: Token holders become stakeholders in network growth
3. **Aligned Incentives**: Compute providers earn tokens, creating natural demand
4. **Decentralization**: No dependency on traditional finance infrastructure
5. **Network Effects**: Early adopters benefit from token appreciation

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: ERC-20 Token (Mobile App Launch)
- Deploy SELF as ERC-20 token on Ethereum/Polygon
- Integrate with DEXs for liquidity
- Accept USDC/USDT for initial token purchases

### Phase 2: Native Coin (Mainnet)
- Migrate to native SELF Chain coin
- Implement bridge for ERC-20 ‚Üí Native conversion
- Full integration with compute rewards

## üìà Future Considerations

### Long-Term Commitments
- 10% discount for annual staking
- Volume discounts for enterprise
- Early adopter rewards: Bonus Shine % for beta users

### Alternative Payment Options
For users who prefer traditional payments:
- **Crypto Payment Processors**: Coinbase Commerce, BitPay for stablecoin payments
- **Partner Exchanges**: Direct fiat-to-SELF conversion partnerships
- **Corporate Accounts**: Separate entity for enterprise fiat billing (future)

## üéØ Success Metrics
- Token holder retention rate
- Compute provider participation
- Average tier upgrade velocity
- Token circulation vs. staking ratio
- Network growth correlation with token adoption
