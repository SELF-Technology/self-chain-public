## Background

The internet began as a vision of decentralized communication - a network where no single entity held control. Over decades, this vision has been systematically eroded. Today's digital landscape is dominated by corporations that harvest data, control access, and dictate terms.

SELF represents a return to the original promise: technology that serves its users, not its overlords.

## 🌟 Overview

SELF Chain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, combining AI-powered validation with true self-sovereignty. We're building a future where personal data ownership isn't just a promise—it's a fundamental right encoded in our technology.

**This isn't just another blockchain. It's a movement.** As everyone should own and control their own data, we believe that everyone should be able to help construct and verify the chain. SELF Chain is built collaboratively by a global community of developers, researchers, and privacy advocates who believe in digital freedom.

### Why SELF Chain?

- **🤖 AI-First Design**: Unlike blockchains that add AI as an afterthought, SELF Chain is built from the ground up with AI at its core
- **🔐 True Data Sovereignty**: Your data, your rules—enforced by cryptography and AI
- **⚡ High Performance**: Designed for real-world scale without compromising decentralization
- **🌍 Open Source Core**: Transparent blockchain protocol with community-driven development
- **🤝 Community Owned**: No single entity controls SELF—it belongs to everyone

## 🚀 Key Features

### Revolutionary Consensus
- **Proof-of-AI (PoAI)**: The world's first AI-driven consensus mechanism
- **Color Marker System**: Advanced transaction validation through hexadecimal state tracking
- **AI Validators**: Intelligent block validation replacing energy-intensive mining

### Enterprise Ready
- **Constellation Architecture**: Deploy industry-specific chains for any regulated sector
- **Innovation Platform**: From healthcare to finance, build compliant blockchain solutions
- **Grid Compute**: Distributed AI computation across the network

### Developer First
- **Multi-Language SDKs**: JavaScript, Rust, Python, and Go planned
- **Private Testnet**: Core development testnet (public testnet coming Q4 2025)
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive docs to guide your journey

## 🚦 Current Status: Active Development

**Core blockchain**: ✅ Working | **Public testnet**: 🔄 In development | **Developer tools**: 📅 Coming Q4 2025

> 📊 See our [Project Status](/project-status) page for detailed information about what's available today.

## 🌍 The Open Source Revolution

**SELF Chain's core protocol is open source** - because we believe that the fundamental infrastructure of digital freedom must be transparent and auditable. As everyone should own and control their own data, we believe that everyone should be able to help construct and verify the chain.

### Our Open Source Approach

- **Core Protocol**: The blockchain, consensus, networking, and cryptography are fully open
- **Security Balance**: Following best practices like Signal, some security parameters remain private
- **Collaboration**: Developers worldwide contribute to make SELF better
- **Community Audit**: The essential infrastructure is transparent and verifiable
- **No Lock-in**: Fork the protocol, modify it, make it yours - true freedom

### The Future: SELF DAO

In the future, we'll be creating **SELF DAO** to progressively decentralize governance, including oversight of security-critical components. This will ensure community control over the entire project. Every major decision, upgrade, and change will be voted on by the community.

## 🛠️ Developer Preview

> 🚧 **EARLY ACCESS**: SELF Chain is in active development. Core blockchain functionality is working, but developer tools (SDKs, APIs, faucet) are currently in development. See our [Project Status](/project-status) for current capabilities.

> ⚠️ **TESTNET WARNING**: SELF Chain is currently in testnet phase. Do not use real assets or deploy production applications. Testnet tokens have no value and the network may be reset at any time.

### For Developers

**Note**: SELF Chain is currently running a private development testnet. Public testnet access is planned for Q4 2025. The instructions below are for developers who want to run a local node or contribute to core development.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public.git
cd self-chain-public

# Build the project (requires Rust 1.70+)
cargo build --release

# Run a local development node
cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --dev

# Note: Connecting to the testnet requires additional configuration
# and is currently limited to core developers
```

> 📄 **Important**: These commands run a local development node only. For detailed setup instructions and current limitations, see our [testnet guide](/Technical%20Docs/Developer%20Resources/Getting_Started_Testnet).
