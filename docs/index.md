## 🚀 Build on SELF

SELF provides open source SDKs and comprehensive documentation for building AI-native applications on the world's first AI-powered blockchain.

### 📦 Official SDKs (Coming Q4 2025)

SDKs for multiple languages are in final development:

- **@self/sdk** - TypeScript/JavaScript SDK
- **self-sdk** - Python SDK  
- **self-sdk** - Rust SDK
- **self-sdk-go** - Go SDK

> 🚧 **Development Status**: SDKs are in final development. [Watch GitHub releases](https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public/releases) for updates.

### 🛠️ What You'll Be Able To Build

When SDKs are released, you'll be able to create applications that:
- **Leverage Personal AI** - Users' AI agents enhance your app experience
- **Preserve Privacy** - AI collaboration without exposing personal data
- **Enable Sovereignty** - Users control their data and AI
- **Scale Globally** - Built on enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure

### 🎯 What Makes SELF Different

**🤖 AI-Native Blockchain Platform**
- World's first blockchain designed from the ground up for AI integration
- Proof-of-AI consensus with intelligent validators and block builders
- Radically simplified development through built-in AI capabilities

**🔐 Privacy by Design**
- Data sovereignty built into every layer
- You control who sees what, always
- No backdoors, no compromises

**🌍 True Decentralization**
- 100% open source core protocol
- Community governed, no corporate control
- Transparent, auditable, trustless

**🚀 Ready to Scale**
- Enterprise-grade Constellation architecture
- Industry-specific blockchain deployment
- Complete ecosystem from blockchain to apps

## 🎯 Getting Ready

While SDKs are in development, here's how to prepare:

**✅ Available Now:**
- 📚 [Review SDK documentation](/building-on-self) and specifications
- 🏗️ [Study the architecture](/technical-docs/self-chain/SELF_Chain_Architecture) 
- 👁️ [Watch the repository](https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public) for SDK updates

**🔄 Coming Q4 2025:**
- SDK installations via npm, pip, cargo, and go get
- Public API gateway access
- Test token faucet

## 🌟 The Open Ecosystem Model

SELF follows a selective open source approach:

### ✅ What Will Be Open Source
- **All SDKs** - Complete client libraries for every language
- **API Specifications** - Full OpenAPI documentation  
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and references
- **Example Applications** - Sample code and tutorials
- **Development Tools** - CLI tools, testing utilities

### 🔒 What Remains Private
- **Core Blockchain** - Security-critical consensus implementation
- **AI Validation** - Proprietary validation algorithms
- **Infrastructure** - Production deployment configurations

This model ensures developers have everything they need while protecting the network's security.
