# üìä SELF Project Status

> **Last Updated**: August 2025

This document provides a transparent, real-time view of what's currently working in SELF, what's being developed, and what's planned for the future. We believe in honest communication about our development progress.

## üéØ Quick Summary

SELF is in **active development** across three main areas: **SELF Chain** testnet with revolutionary Proof-of-AI consensus, **SELF Super-App** with integrated AI assistant, and **SELF Studio** - the AI-native development environment that will be built into the Super-App. We are also formalizing the **Stellar Network** growth model: subscription-based membership (Protostars), non-transferable **Stars** for daily usage, and governance via the first **100,000 active subscribers** forming the SELF DAO stewarding 150M tokens.
