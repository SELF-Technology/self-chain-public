# 📊 SELF Project Status

> **Last Updated**: July 2025

This document provides a transparent, real-time view of what's currently working in SELF, what's being developed, and what's planned for the future. We believe in honest communication about our development progress.

## 🎯 Quick Summary

SELF is in **active development** with a working testnet demonstrating our revolutionary Proof-of-AI consensus on SELF Chain. While core blockchain functionality is operational, many user-facing features are still being built.

**If you're looking to:**
- ✅ **Run a testnet node** - You can do this today (with technical expertise)
- ⏳ **Use developer tools (SDK/API)** - Coming soon
- ⏳ **Get testnet tokens** - Faucet coming soon
- ❌ **Deploy production applications** - Not ready yet

---

## ✅ What's Working Today

### Core Blockchain
- **Status**: ✅ Operational
- **Details**: 
  - Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus mechanism fully functional
  - Block creation and validation working
  - 3-node testnet successfully deployed on AWS
  - Basic transaction processing operational
- **Limitations**: 
  - Requires technical expertise to set up
  - No public API access yet
  - Manual configuration required

### Testnet Network
- **Status**: ✅ Running (Limited Access)
- **Details**:
  - Bootstrap node: `http://13.220.156.247:3030`
  - Peer nodes operational and syncing
  - Network may be reset periodically
- **Access**: Currently requires manual node setup - no easy connection method

### Open Source Code
- **Status**: ✅ Available
- **Repository**: [github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public](https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public)
- **Includes**: Blockchain core, consensus, networking, storage, cryptography
- **Note**: Some security-critical components remain private

## 🔄 In Active Development

### Testnet API Gateway
- **Status**: 🔄 Active Development
- **Progress**: Specification complete, implementation pending
- **Blocking**: Developer access to testnet
- **Details**: [API Gateway Documentation](/Technical%20Docs/Developer%20Resources/Testnet_API_Gateway)

### Developer SDKs
- **Status**: 🔄 Planning
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript (first), Python, Rust, Go
- **Timeline**: Following API Gateway deployment
- **Current State**: Architecture designed, waiting on API

### Configuration & Setup Tools
- **Status**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Includes**: 
  - Testnet configuration templates
  - Docker images for easy deployment
  - Setup automation scripts

---

## 📅 Planned Features (Not Started)

### Developer Experience
- **Token Faucet**: Discord bot for testnet token distribution
- **Block Explorer**: Web interface to view blockchain activity  
- **CLI Tools**: Published to package managers (npm, crates.io)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tutorials and guides

### Platform Features
- **Super-App Integration**: Mobile and web applications
- **Token Launch**: Native SELF token and economics
- **Multi-User Platform**: Subscription services with isolated environments
- **Grid Compute Network**: Distributed AI computation (2026)

### Enterprise Features
- **Constellation Networks**: Industry-specific blockchain deployment
- **Admin Dashboard**: Management interface for operators
- **Billing Integration**: Subscription and payment processing

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Current State
1. **No Production Use**: This is a testnet - do not use for real applications
2. **No Token Value**: Testnet tokens have zero monetary value
3. **Unstable Network**: Expect resets, downtime, and breaking changes
4. **Limited Documentation**: Many features documented but not yet implemented
5. **High Technical Bar**: Currently requires blockchain development experience

### What You Cannot Do Yet
- ❌ Connect to testnet via public API
- ❌ Use SDKs to build applications
- ❌ Get testnet tokens from a faucet
- ❌ View transactions in a block explorer
- ❌ Deploy smart contracts
- ❌ Run production workloads

## 🛠️ For Developers

### What You Can Do Today

1. **Clone and Build the Node**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public.git
   cd self-chain-public
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run a Local Test Node**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --dev
   ```

3. **Explore the Codebase**
   - Review the open source implementation
   - Understand the architecture
   - Prepare for SDK release

### What's Coming Soon

- **Easy Testnet Access**: Connect without running a full node
- **Developer Tools**: SDKs, APIs, and documentation
- **Test Tokens**: Faucet for development and testing
- **Support Channels**: Active developer community
