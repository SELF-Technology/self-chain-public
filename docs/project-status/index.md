# 📊 SELF Project Status

> **Last Updated**: July 2025

This document provides a transparent, real-time view of what's currently working in SELF, what's being developed, and what's planned for the future. We believe in honest communication about our development progress.

## 🎯 Quick Summary

SELF is in **active development** with a working testnet demonstrating our revolutionary Proof-of-AI consensus on SELF Chain. While core blockchain functionality is operational, many user-facing features are still being built.

**If you're looking to:**
- ⏳ **Explore SDK documentation** - Coming Q4 2025
- ⏳ **Get testnet tokens** - Faucet coming soon
- ❌ **Deploy production applications** - Not ready yet

## ✅ What's Working Today

### Core Blockchain
- **Status**: ✅ Operational (Testnet)
- **Details**: 
  - Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus mechanism in testing phase
  - Block creation and validation working in controlled environment
  - 3-node testnet deployed on AWS for internal testing
  - Basic transaction processing operational
- **Limitations**: 
  - Testnet only - not production ready
  - Requires technical expertise to set up
  - No public API access yet
  - Manual configuration required
  - Network may reset without notice

### Testnet Network
- **Status**: ✅ Running (Internal Testing)
- **Details**:
  - Internal testnet operational for development
  - **⚠️ WARNING**: Network resets frequently for testing
  - **⚠️ WARNING**: All testnet data is temporary
- **Developer Access**: Coming Q3 2025 via API Gateway (no node setup required)

### SDK & Documentation
- **Status**: 🔄 Coming Q4 2025
- **Repository**: [github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public](https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public)
- **Planned Features**: 
  - TypeScript SDK with basic blockchain interaction
  - Python SDK for AI/data science integration
  - API specifications and developer guides
  - Comprehensive SDK documentation
- **Timeline**: Q4 2025 release with Rust and Go SDKs, full MCP integration

---

## 🔄 In Active Development

### Enhanced Developer Tools
- **Status**: 🔄 Active Development
- **Progress**: 
  - SDK development in progress
  - Core architecture design complete
  - MCP integration planned
- **Planned Languages**: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go
- **Timeline**: Full SDK release Q4 2025
- **Details**: SDKs will include MCP support and advanced blockchain features

### Configuration & Setup Tools
- **Status**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Includes**: 
  - Testnet configuration templates
  - Docker images for easy deployment
  - Setup automation scripts

---

## 📅 Planned Features

### Developer Experience
- **Token Faucet**: Discord bot for testnet token distribution
- **Block Explorer**: Web interface to view blockchain activity  
- **CLI Tools**: Published to package managers (npm, crates.io)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tutorials and guides

### Platform Features
- **Super-App Integration**: Mobile and web applications

- **Admin Dashboard**: Management interface for operators
- **Billing Integration**: Subscription and payment processing

---

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Current State
1. **No Production Use**: This is a testnet - do not use for real applications
2. **No Token Value**: Testnet tokens have zero monetary value
3. **Unstable Network**: Expect resets, downtime, and breaking changes
4. **Limited Documentation**: Many features documented but not yet implemented
5. **Development Phase**: SDKs will abstract blockchain complexity for easy development

### What You Cannot Do Yet
- ❌ Use SDKs to build applications
- ❌ Get testnet tokens from a faucet
- ❌ View transactions in a block explorer
- ❌ Deploy smart contracts
- ❌ Run production workloads
