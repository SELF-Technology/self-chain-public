# Governance

## Overview

SELF Chain follows a progressive decentralization model, moving from core team leadership to community governance. This document outlines our current governance structure and future roadmap.

## Current Governance Model (Phase 1: Foundation)

### Core Team Responsibilities

The SELF Technology core team currently maintains:
- Technical direction and architecture decisions
- Security policy and incident response
- Release management and versioning
- Community moderation and support

### Community Input

While final decisions rest with the core team, we actively seek community input through:
- **RFC Process**: Request for Comments on major changes
- **GitHub Discussions**: Open forum for technical proposals
- **Discord Feedback**: Real-time community input
- **Quarterly Surveys**: Structured feedback collection

## Decision Making Process

### 1. Proposal Stage
- Anyone can propose changes via GitHub Issues or Discussions
- Proposals should include:
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed solution
  - Alternative approaches considered
  - Impact assessment

### 2. Discussion Stage
- Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
- Core team technical review
- Security impact assessment
- Economic impact analysis (if applicable)

### 3. Decision Stage
- Core team evaluates community feedback
- Decision published with rationale
- Implementation timeline shared

### 4. Implementation Stage
- Development according to roadmap
- Community testing and feedback
- Iterative improvements

## Types of Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- Protocol changes
- API modifications
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements

**Process**: RFC → Technical Review → Core Team Decision

### Community Decisions
- Code of Conduct updates
- Community guidelines
- Event planning
- Educational initiatives

**Process**: Community Discussion → Rough Consensus → Implementation

### Economic Decisions
- Token economics (future)
- Fee structures
- Incentive mechanisms
- Grant allocations

**Process**: Economic Analysis → Community Input → Core Team Decision

## Contribution Recognition

### Levels of Contributors

1. **Core Contributors**
   - Commit access to main repositories
   - Participation in security discussions
   - Vote in technical decisions

2. **Regular Contributors**
   - Consistent quality contributions
   - Trusted reviewer status
   - Priority issue assignment

3. **Community Contributors**
   - All external contributors
   - Access to bounties and grants
   - Recognition in contributor list

### Becoming a Core Contributor

Requirements:
- 6+ months of consistent contributions
- Deep understanding of codebase
- Alignment with project values
- Nomination by existing core contributor
- Security clearance process

## Future Governance Roadmap

### Phase 2: Community Expansion (6-12 months)
- Technical Advisory Board formation
- Community grants program
- Formal RFC process
- Contributor DAO experiments

### Phase 3: Decentralized Governance (12-24 months)
- On-chain governance implementation
- Token-weighted voting for protocol changes
- Community treasury management
- Fully decentralized decision making

### Phase 4: Full DAO Transition (24+ months)
- Complete decentralization

- Financial reports (when applicable)
- Roadmap updates

### What Remains Private
- Security vulnerabilities until patched
- Personal information
- Legal matters
- Strategic partnerships until announced

## Communication Channels

### Official Channels
- **GitHub**: Code, issues, discussions
- **Discord**: Real-time community chat
- **Blog**: Major announcements
- **Twitter/X**: Updates and news

### Decision Announcements
- GitHub Discussions for technical decisions
- Discord #announcements for community updates
- Blog posts for major changes
- Email list for security notices

## Governance Meetings

### Core Team Meetings
- Weekly technical sync
- Monthly strategic planning
- Quarterly roadmap review

### Community Meetings
- Bi-weekly community calls (recorded)
- Monthly contributor sync
- Quarterly town halls

## Amendments to Governance

This governance model can be updated through:
1. Proposal via GitHub Discussion
2. 30-day comment period
3. Core team review and revision
4. Community notification
5. 7-day grace period before activation
