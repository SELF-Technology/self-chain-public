# AI-Capacity Class Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of AI-capacity classes throughout the SELF Chain system, replacing the legacy Mini* classes with more AI-focused counterparts.

## Core Components

### 1. AI-Capacity Classes
- **AIData**: Replaces MiniData for AI-focused data representation
- **AICapacityNumber**: Replaces MiniNumber for AI-capacity focused numeric calculations

### 2. System Components Updated

#### Governance System
- **GovernanceContract**: Manages stake and proposal operations using AICapacityNumber
- **GovernanceProposal**: Handles proposal creation and voting using AICapacityNumber
- **ProposalEvaluator**: Evaluates proposals using AI metrics with AICapacityNumber

```java
// Example usage:
AIData nodeId = new AIData("node_123");
AIData proposalId = new AIData("proposal_456");
```
