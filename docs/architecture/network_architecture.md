# SELF Chain Network Architecture

## Overview
SELF Chain implements a robust peer-to-peer network architecture that ensures secure, efficient, and reliable communication between nodes. The network layer is built on top of modern distributed systems principles and integrates with OrbitDB for distributed storage.

## Key Components

### 1. Peer Discovery
- Periodic peer discovery from bootstrap nodes
- Peer-to-peer discovery through known peers
- Peer stats tracking and reliability scoring
- Network topology metrics

### 2. Message Routing
- Gossipsub for message propagation
- Kademlia for peer discovery
- Routing table with peer statistics
- Message forwarding with TTL
- Flood threshold protection

### 3. Connection Management
- Connection pooling per peer
- Connection timeout handling
- Active connection tracking
- Error handling and recovery

### 4. Security Features
- TLS encryption for all peer connections
- Message signing and verification
- Peer authentication
- Network message validation

## Network Topology

### Peer Discovery
- Bootstrap nodes for initial peer discovery
- Peer-to-peer discovery for network expansion
- Reputation-based peer selection
- Connection pooling for resource management

### Message Flow
1. Message generation and signing
2. Routing through optimized peer paths
3. Message validation at each hop
4. Delivery to destination or flooding

### Security Model
- End-to-end encryption
- Message integrity verification
- Peer authentication
- Network intrusion detection

## Performance Optimization
