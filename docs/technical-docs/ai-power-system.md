# AI Power System

The AI Power system is SELF's revolutionary approach to managing cloud compute resources and user access. Unlike traditional percentage-based metrics, AI Power represents actual compute allocation and usage in a user-friendly metaphor.

## Overview

**AI Power** is an intuitive system that directly represents your cloud compute resources and AI capabilities.

### Key Concepts

- **AI Power**: Your allocated cloud compute resources for AI processing
- **Power Depletion**: Natural consumption as you use AI services
- **Power Regeneration**: Monthly reset based on your subscription tier
- **Power Orb**: Visual representation in the desktop app interface

## How AI Power Works

### Resource Allocation

Each subscription tier provides different AI Power allocations:

| Tier | Monthly Price | Cloud Infrastructure |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Free Trial** 💫 | $0 | 30-day trial node (100MB RAM, 0.1 vCPU) |
| **SELF Cloud Starter** 🚀 | $8.99 | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, 20TB bandwidth |
| **SELF Cloud Pro** ⭐ | $12.99 | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB SSD, 1TB bandwidth |
| **SELF Cloud Pro+** 🌟 | $24.99 | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB SSD, 2TB bandwidth |

### Usage Consumption

AI Power is consumed based on computational complexity:

```javascript
// Example consumption rates
const aiPowerUsage = {
  simpleChat: 1,           // Basic conversation
  complexReasoning: 5,     // Advanced AI reasoning
  codeGeneration: 3,       // Programming assistance
  imageAnalysis: 4,        // Visual AI processing
  documentProcessing: 2,   // Text analysis
  browserAutomation: 2,    // Web interaction
  secureMessaging: 1       // Encrypted communications
};
```

## AI Power Orb Visualization

### Desktop Interface

The AI Power Orb is the central visual element in the SELF desktop app:

- **Neural Network Design**: Flowing energy patterns represent active AI processing
- **SELF Logo Integration**: Centered logo with optimal opacity
- **Dynamic Animations**: Pulsing effects that respond to usage
- **Percentage Display**: Clear remaining power indication
- **Theme Compatibility**: Works in both light and dark modes

### Visual States

```css
.ai-power-orb {
  /* High Power (75-100%) */
  --energy-flow: rapid;
  --glow-intensity: high;
  --color-primary: #3B82F6;
  
  /* Medium Power (25-74%) */
  --energy-flow: moderate;
  --glow-intensity: medium;
  --color-primary: #F59E0B;
  
  /* Low Power (0-24%) */
  --energy-flow: slow;
  --glow-intensity: low;
  --color-primary: #EF4444;
}
```

## Cloud Architecture Integration

### Node Allocation

AI Power directly maps to cloud infrastructure:

1. **User Registration**: Private cloud node provisioned
2. **Tier Selection**: Node resources scaled based on AI Power allocation
3. **Real-time Scaling**: Dynamic resource adjustment as power is consumed
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Nodes deployed in optimal locations

    D --> E[Response Delivery]
    E --> F[AI Power Deduction]
```

## Developer Integration

### AI Power API

```javascript
// Check user's AI Power
const powerStatus = await selfSDK.aiPower.getStatus();
console.log(`Remaining: ${powerStatus.remaining}/${powerStatus.total}`);

// Request AI processing with power check
const result = await selfSDK.ai.process({
  prompt: "Analyze this code for security issues",
  model: "claude-3-sonnet",
  estimatedPower: 5
});

// Monitor power consumption
selfSDK.aiPower.onConsumption((usage) => {
  updatePowerOrb(usage.remaining);
});
```

### Power Management

```javascript
// AI Power pooling for collaborative features
const helpSession = await selfSDK.collaboration.offer({
  helper: currentUser,
  requester: 'user-needing-help.self',
  expertise: 'smart-contract-development',
  compensation: {
    type: 'ai-power-percentage',
    amount: 10 // 10% of helper's AI Power
  }
});
```

## Benefits Over Traditional Metrics

### User Experience

- **Intuitive Understanding**: "Power" is more relatable than "percentage"
- **Visual Appeal**: Neural network orb is more engaging than progress bars
- **Purpose Clarity**: Directly represents computational capability

### Technical Advantages

- **Scalable Mapping**: AI Power units can represent varying computational complexity
- **Resource Optimization**: Direct correlation with actual cloud costs
- **Flexible Pricing**: Easy to adjust rates based on infrastructure costs


## Future Enhancements

### Grid Compute Integration

As SELF evolves to include user-contributed compute:

- **Power Generation**: Users can earn AI Power by contributing compute resources
- **Marketplace**: Trade AI Power between users
- **Staking Rewards**: Additional AI Power for token stakers

### Advanced Features

- **Power Banking**: Save unused AI Power for future months
- **Burst Capacity**: Temporary power boosts for intensive tasks
- **Group Pooling**: Share AI Power within organizations
- **Priority Queuing**: Premium processing for high-tier users

## Implementation Notes

### Desktop App Integration

The AI Power system is fully integrated into the SELF desktop app:

- **Real-time Updates**: Power Orb reflects current usage
- **Notifications**: Alerts when power is running low
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Easy tier upgrades when needed
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed consumption tracking

### Cloud Synchronization

- **Cross-device Sync**: AI Power status synchronized across all user devices
- **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when disconnected
- **Conflict Resolution**: Proper handling of simultaneous usage
