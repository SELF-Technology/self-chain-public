# Stellar Network

The Stellar Network is SELF's participation and growth system based on non-transferable daily usage credits called "Stars" and a subscription-based model with comprehensive rewards.

## Key Concepts

- Stars: Daily usage credits that measure engagement (not tokens, not transferable)
- Tiers: Stardust 30/day, Protostar 60/day, Rising 90/day, Supernova 120/day, Hypernova 150/day
- Subscription Tiers: 8 tiers from SELF Zero (free) to SELF Enterprise ($160)
- Network Bonus: 1 SELF per 1,000 Stars used by your invited network
- Rewards: Comprehensive SELF Rewards program with subscription bonuses and network building incentives
