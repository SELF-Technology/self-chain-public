# Stellar Network

The Stellar Network is SELF's participation and growth system based on non-transferable daily usage credits called "Stars" and a subscription-based cohort (Protostars) that governs DAO decision making.

## Key Concepts

- Stars: Daily usage credits that measure engagement (not tokens, not transferable)
- Tiers: Stardust 30/day, Protostar 60/day, Rising 90/day, Supernova 120/day, Hypernova 150/day
- Protostar Cohort: First 100,000 paid subscribers receive a DAO seat while active
- Network Bonus: 1 SELF per 1,000 Stars used by your invited network
- Rewards: Onboarding and invite rewards sourced from DAO-managed pools (subject to governance)

## Subscription Tiers (Storage)

| Tier | Monthly_Price | Storage |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **SELF Zero** | **$0 (Free Forever)** | **Local only (0GB)** |
| **SELF Lite** | **$5.00** | **25GB** |
| **SELF Standard** | **$10.00** | **50GB** |
| **SELF Pro** | **$20.00** | **100GB** |
| **SELF Pro+** | **$40.00** | **250GB** |
| **SELF Business** | **$80.00** | **500GB** |
| **SELF Enterprise** | **$160.00** | **1TB** |

## DAO Governance Linkage

- Membership requires an active subscription; churned seats are auto-replaced
- Authority over 150M SELF across User Adoption (75M) and Developer Incentives (75M)
- Proposal lifecycle and thresholds are finalized by governance and published in `studio/dao-governance`

## Notes

- Stars â‰  Tokens. Stars measure usage; token rewards are governed by the DAO.
- Infrastructure providers are intentionally not specified; SELF uses a private cloud model.
