# SELF Chain Advanced TPS Optimization

:::warning Performance Targets
The metrics described in this document represent theoretical performance optimization targets and architectural design goals, not achieved performance. These are aspirational targets based on our planned architecture.

**Current Reality**: Testnet achieves ~1,000 TPS in controlled environments. The 50,000+ TPS target requires all optimizations described here to be fully implemented and tested.

## Overview
This document outlines the planned advanced optimizations and benchmarking capabilities for SELF Chain, with a long-term goal of achieving high-performance transaction processing.

## Core Optimizations

### 1. Advanced Sharding
- Geographic-based sharding
- Dynamic load balancing
- Network latency optimization
- Parallel validation
- Cross-shard optimization

### 2. Hardware Acceleration
- GPU acceleration
- SIMD (AVX/SSE) optimization
- Cache optimization
- Batch processing
- Memory efficiency

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time TPS tracking
- Latency measurement
- Resource utilization
- Network monitoring
- Alert system

### 4. Benchmarking Suite
- Multiple load patterns
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Validation time
- Network bandwidth

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Sharding
```rust
struct ShardingManager {
    config: ShardingConfig,
    shards: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Shard>>>,
    rebalance_interval: tokio::time::Interval,
}
```

### Benchmarking
```rust
struct BenchmarkSuite {
    config: BenchmarkConfig,
    metrics: Arc<RwLock<BenchmarkMetrics>>,
    grid_compute: Arc<GridCompute>,
    performance_monitor: Arc<PerformanceMonitor>,
}
```

## Performance Targets (Aspirational)
- Target TPS: 50,000+ transactions per second (long-term design goal, not yet achieved)
- Peak TPS Target: 100,000+ transactions per second (theoretical maximum requiring all optimizations)
- Target Average Latency: < 1ms (under optimal conditions)
- Target Network Latency: < 10ms (datacenter environments)
- Memory Usage: Optimization in progress
- Target CPU Utilization: < 90% (at full load)
- Target GPU Utilization: < 90% (when GPU acceleration enabled)

## Benchmarking Scenarios
1. Constant Load
2. Ramp-Up Load
3. Spike Load
4. Random Load
