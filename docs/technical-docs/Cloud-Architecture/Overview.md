# Cloud Architecture Overview

## IMPORTANT: How SELF Chain Cloud Works

### What SELF Does (Not You)
When a user signs up through the **SELF Super-App**, we automatically:
1. ✅ Provision their private cloud instance
2. ✅ Deploy their SELF Chain node
3. ✅ Set up their private LLM
4. ✅ Configure their decentralized storage
5. ✅ Manage all infrastructure

**Users get their cloud automatically. Developers don't provision anything.**

### What Developers Do
As a developer, you:
1. 🔨 Build apps that interact with user instances
2. 🔨 Access user data (with permission) via APIs
3. 🔨 Create experiences using their private LLM
4. 🔨 Store data in their sovereign storage

**You build on top of the infrastructure, you don't create it.**

## For Users: Your Private Cloud

When you sign up for SELF through our Super-App, you automatically get:

### Your Own Private Universe
- **Dedicated Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage just for you
- **Private AI Assistant**: An LLM that learns from you and never shares your data
- **Blockchain Node**: Participate in the network and earn rewards
- **Sovereign Storage**: Your data, encrypted and under your control

### Complete Privacy
- Your conversations never leave your instance
- Your data is never accessible to SELF or other users
- End-to-end encryption by default
- You own your digital life

## For Developers: Building on SELF

### You Don't Manage Infrastructure

**SELF handles:**
- ❌ Server provisioning
- ❌ Docker containers
- ❌ Cloud accounts
- ❌ Resource allocation
- ❌ Scaling
- ❌ Monitoring

**You focus on:**
- ✅ Building great apps
- ✅ Creating user experiences
- ✅ Integrating with user instances
- ✅ Respecting user privacy

### How to Build Apps for SELF Users

#### 1. User Authentication
Users log in with their SELF account:
```javascript
// User authorizes your app
const auth = await SELF.authenticate({
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  permissions: ['ai:chat', 'storage:read']
});
```

#### 2. Interact with User's Private LLM
```javascript
// Chat with user's private AI (with permission)
const response = await auth.ai.chat({
  message: "Help me plan my day",
  context: "productivity"
});
```

#### 3. Store in User's Sovereign Storage
```javascript
// Save to user's private storage (with permission)
await auth.storage.save({
  key: 'app-data',
  value: { preferences: {...} },
  encrypted: true
});
```

### What You Can Build

#### ✅ Apps That Enhance User's AI
- Custom AI personalities
- Specialized knowledge bases
- AI-powered tools
- Workflow automation

#### ✅ Privacy-Preserving Services
- Encrypted messaging using user's instance
- Private document analysis
- Secure collaboration tools
- Personal data insights

#### ✅ Decentralized Applications
- Social networks where users own their data
- Content platforms with user sovereignty
- Marketplaces with privacy
- Gaming with persistent user state

### What You Cannot Do

#### ❌ Access Without Permission
- Cannot read user data without explicit consent
- Cannot use their AI without authorization
- Cannot bypass privacy controls
- Cannot see other users' data

#### ❌ Provision Infrastructure
- Cannot create user instances (SELF does this)
- Cannot manage cloud resources
- Cannot access underlying servers
- Cannot modify user's node

## Getting Started as a Developer

### 1. Get Testnet Access
```bash
# Request testnet developer account
curl -X POST https://testnet.self.app/developers/register \
  -d '{"email": "dev@example.com", "project": "My App"}'
```

### 2. Install SDK
```bash
npm install @self/sdk
```

### 3. Build Your First App
```javascript
import { SELFClient } from '@self/sdk';

const client = new SELFClient({
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  environment: 'testnet'
});

// Your app interacts with authorized user instances
```

### 4. Test Locally
Use our testnet to develop without real users:
- Get test user credentials
- Simulate user interactions
- Test permission flows
- Validate privacy model

## Architecture Details

### User Instance Components

Each user's cloud instance includes:

```
User's Private Cloud Instance
├── SELF Chain Node (Blockchain participation)
├── Private LLM (AI assistant)
├── OrbitDB (Decentralized database)
├── IPFS Node (Distributed storage)
└── API Gateway (Secure access point)
```

### Security Boundaries

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   User A's Instance (Isolated)  │
│  ┌─────────────┐ ┌────────────┐ │
│  │ Private LLM │ │   Storage  │ │
│  └─────────────┘ └────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         ⚡ No Connection ⚡
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   User B's Instance (Isolated)  │
│  ┌─────────────┐ ┌────────────┐ │
│  │ Private LLM │ │   Storage  │ │
│  └─────────────┘ └────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Developer Access Model

```
Your App → SELF SDK → User Authorization → User's Instance API
                           ↓
                    Permission Granted
                           ↓
                    Scoped Access Only
```

## Summary

### For Users
- Sign up in SELF Super-App
- Get automatic private cloud
- Own your data and AI
- Complete privacy

### For Developers  
- Build apps on top of user instances
- Use SDK to interact with authorized users
- Respect privacy and permissions
- Focus on user experience, not infrastructure

**Remember: SELF provisions and manages all infrastructure. Developers build experiences. Users own their digital lives.**
