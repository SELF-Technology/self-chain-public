# Hybrid Storage Architecture

> üèõÔ∏è **Architectural Vision**: This document describes the planned hybrid storage architecture for SELF Chain. Implementation is ongoing as we build towards this comprehensive decentralized storage vision.

## Overview
The SELF Chain hybrid storage architecture combines multiple decentralized storage solutions to provide a robust and efficient storage system. This architecture leverages the strengths of each storage solution while mitigating their weaknesses.

## Core Components

### 1. IPFS Integration
- Content-addressable storage
- Decentralized file system
- Immutable data storage
- Permanent file storage
- Cross-chain file sharing

#### Validation Proof Storage
- Permanent storage of validation proofs
- Content-addressable validation records
- Cross-chain data storage
- Immutable validation history

#### Use Cases
- Store validator certificates
- Store validation proofs
- Store cross-chain validation data
- Store reputation history

### 2. OrbitDB Integration
- Decentralized database
- Real-time synchronization
- Event logging
- Version control
- Validator data storage

### 3. Storage Layer Integration
**Storage Layer Architecture:**

The hybrid storage architecture consists of three main components connected to the Storage Layer:

1. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**:
   - File Storage: Handles decentralized file storage and retrieval
   - Content Addressing: Uses content-based addressing for immutable file references

2. **OrbitDB**:
   - Database: Provides decentralized database functionality
   - Real-time Sync: Enables real-time data synchronization across nodes

3. **Validator Storage**:
   - Validator Data: Stores validator profiles, certificates, and performance metrics
   - Cross-chain Sync: Synchronizes validator data across different blockchain networks

This architecture combines the strengths of each storage solution to provide a robust, decentralized storage system for SELF Chain.

## Data Flow

### 1. File Storage
1. Files are uploaded to IPFS
2. Content is addressed via CID
3. Metadata is stored in OrbitDB
4. Cross-chain references are maintained

### 2. Validator Data
1. Validator profiles in OrbitDB
2. Validation proofs in IPFS
3. Reputation scores in OrbitDB
4. Cross-chain validation tracking

## Key Features

### 1. Redundancy
- Multiple storage layers
- Data replication
- Cross-chain backup
- Version control

### 2. Performance
- Content caching
- Load balancing
- Network optimization
- Bandwidth management

### 3. Security
