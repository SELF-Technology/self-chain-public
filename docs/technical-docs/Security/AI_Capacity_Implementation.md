# AI-Capacity Class Implementation

> ðŸš§ **Development Notice**: The AI capacity implementation is currently under active development. Code examples and features described here represent our architectural approach and are subject to change.

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of AI-capacity classes throughout the SELF Chain system, providing AI-focused data representation and numeric calculations.

## Core Components

### 1. AI-Capacity Classes
- **AIData**: AI-focused data representation for identifiers and data structures
- **AICapacityNumber**: AI-capacity focused numeric calculations with enhanced precision

### 2. System Components Updated

#### Governance System
- **GovernanceContract**: Manages stake and proposal operations using AICapacityNumber
- **GovernanceProposal**: Handles proposal creation and voting using AICapacityNumber
- **ProposalEvaluator**: Evaluates proposals using AI metrics with AICapacityNumber (see [Proof-of-AI documentation](https://docs.self.app/technical-docs/PoAI/proof-of-ai))
- **MLModel**: Predicts proposal success using AI-capacity metrics
- **PointBasedVoting**: Manages point-based voting operations with AICapacityNumber
- **Proposal**: Manages proposal lifecycle with AICapacityNumber

#### Proposal Features
- AICapacityNumber-based vote tracking
- AICapacityNumber-based scoring system
- Parameter management
- Status tracking
- Timestamp support
- String formatting support
- Integration with governance system

#### Governance Contract Features
- Stake Management:
  - Stake operations using AICapacityNumber
  - Precise stake calculations
  - Stake distribution tracking
  - Total stake tracking
- Proposal Management:
  - Proposal creation with AICapacityNumber thresholds
  - Voting with stake-weighted AICapacityNumber
  - Approval percentage calculations
  - Active proposal tracking
- Integration:
  - Cloud node registry integration
  - SelfLogger integration
  - Parameter threshold integration

#### Point-Based Voting System
- **Voting Power Calculation**: Uses AICapacityNumber for precise calculations
- **Reputation Bonus**: Uses AICapacityNumber for reputation-based bonuses
- **Proposal Points**: Tracks proposal points using AICapacityNumber
- **Approval Threshold**: Uses AICapacityNumber for threshold calculations
- **User Votes Tracking**: Uses AIData for user and proposal IDs
- **Vote Recording**: Uses AICapacityNumber for vote weights

#### Vote Features
- AICapacityNumber-based vote value
- AIData-based ID tracking (vote, proposal, validator)
- Vote reason tracking
- Timestamp support
- String formatting support
- Integration with governance system

#### Reward System
- **RewardMetrics**: Tracks reward distributions and validations
- **RewardDistribution**: Manages reward amount calculations
- **RewardValidation**: Handles validation scoring
- **RewardMonitor**: Monitors system metrics
- **CloudNodeManager**: Manages cloud node resources and rewards

#### Cloud Node Management Features
- AICapacityNumber-based resource allocation
- AICapacityNumber-based reputation tracking
- AICapacityNumber-based uptime tracking
- Node participation tracking
- Resource allocation validation
- Reputation score validation
- Uptime validation
- Reward calculation support
- Integration with AI validator system

#### Node Participation
- **NodeParticipation**: Manages node metrics and rewards
- **CloudNodeManager**: Handles cloud node operations
- **CloudNodeRegistry**: Manages node registration

### 3. Key Changes

#### Type System
- `AIData` used for all identifier types
- `AICapacityNumber` used for all numeric calculations
- All arithmetic operations use AICapacityNumber methods
- All comparison operations use AICapacityNumber
