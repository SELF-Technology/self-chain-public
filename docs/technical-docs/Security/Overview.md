# SELF Chain Security Overview

## 1. Security Architecture

The SELF Chain implements a multi-layered security approach incorporating:

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
   - Hybrid cryptographic approach combining classical and quantum-resistant algorithms
   - Kyber-1024 for quantum-resistant key exchange
   - SPHINCS+ for quantum-resistant signatures
   - Continuously evolving defenses against emerging quantum threats

2. **AI-Powered Validation**
   - Advanced AI validation system
   - Context-aware transaction analysis
   - Reputation-based validator selection

3. **Consensus Security**
   - PoAI (Proof-of-AI) consensus mechanism
   - Voting-based validation
   - Validator reputation system

4. **Network Security**
   - Secure peer discovery
   - Encrypted communication
   - Message validation
