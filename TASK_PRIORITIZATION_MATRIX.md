# SELF Chain Task Prioritization Matrix
*Last Updated: July 10, 2025*

## Overview
This matrix tracks all development tasks for SELF Chain, prioritized using the ICE (Impact × Confidence × Ease) scoring method.

### Task Completion Criteria
A task is only considered **"Completed"** when ALL 5 criteria are met:
- ✍️ **Code Written** - Implementation exists
- 🔗 **Integrated** - Connected to main application
- 🧪 **Tested** - Has test coverage
- 🚀 **Accessible** - Can be used/accessed
- 📖 **Documented** - Has documentation

## Testnet Status
**✅ 3-Node Testnet Successfully Deployed (July 2, 2025)**
- Bootstrap Node: http://13.220.156.247:3030
- Peer Node 1: http://34.203.202.6:3030
- Peer Node 2: http://52.23.226.218:3030

⚠️ **Critical Gap**: Testnet is running but lacks developer access tools
