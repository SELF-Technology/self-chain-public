# SELF - Open Source SDKs & Documentation

## 🚀 Build on SELF

SELF provides open source SDKs and comprehensive documentation for building AI-native applications on the world's first AI-powered blockchain.

### 📦 Official SDKs (Coming Q4 2025)

SDKs for multiple languages are in final development:

- **@self/sdk** - TypeScript/JavaScript SDK
- **self-sdk** - Python SDK  
- **self-sdk** - Rust SDK
- **self-sdk-go** - Go SDK

> 🚧 **Development Status**: SDKs are in final development. [Watch GitHub releases](https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public/releases) for updates.
