## 🌟 Overview

SELF Chain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, combining AI-powered validation with true self-sovereignty. We're building a future where personal data ownership isn't just a promise—it's a fundamental right encoded in our technology.

### Why SELF Chain?

- **🤖 AI-First Design**: Unlike blockchains that add AI as an afterthought, SELF Chain is built from the ground up with AI at its core
- **🔐 True Data Sovereignty**: Your data, your rules—enforced by cryptography and AI
- **⚡ 50,000 TPS Target**: Designed for real-world scale without compromising decentralization
- **🌍 Open Source**: Transparent development with a vibrant community

## 🚀 Key Features

### Revolutionary Consensus
- **Proof-of-AI (PoAI)**: The world's first AI-driven consensus mechanism
- **Color Marker System**: Advanced transaction validation through hexadecimal state tracking
- **AI Validators**: Intelligent block validation replacing energy-intensive mining

### Enterprise Ready

- **Innovation Platform**: From healthcare to finance, build compliant blockchain solutions
- **Grid Compute**: Distributed AI computation across the network

### Developer First
- **Comprehensive SDKs**: JavaScript, Rust, Python, and Go (coming soon)
- **Testnet Available**: Build and test today with our live testnet
- **Extensive Documentation**: World-class docs to get you started quickly

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### For Developers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public.git
cd self-chain-public

# Copy testnet configuration
cp config/testnet.example.toml config/testnet.toml

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run a testnet node
cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --testnet
```

> ⚠️ **Testnet Notice**: SELF Chain is currently in testnet. Tokens have no value and the network may reset.

### Get Testnet Tokens

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/WdMdVpA4C8) and use the `!faucet` command to receive testnet tokens.
