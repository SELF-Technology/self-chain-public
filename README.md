## 🌟 Overview: SELF - The Future Of Technology Is Yours

SELF Chain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, combining AI-powered validation with true self-sovereignty. We're building a future where personal data ownership isn't just a promise—it's a fundamental right encoded in our technology.

**This isn't just another blockchain. It's a movement.** As everyone should own and control their own data, we believe that everyone should be able to help construct and verify the chain. SELF Chain is built collaboratively by a global community of developers, researchers, and privacy advocates who believe in digital freedom.

### Why SELF Chain?

- **🤖 AI-First Design**: Unlike blockchains that add AI as an afterthought, SELF Chain is built from the ground up with AI at its core
- **🔐 True Data Sovereignty**: Your data, your rules—enforced by cryptography and AI
- **⚡ 50,000 TPS Target**: Designed for real-world scale without compromising decentralization
- **🌍 Open Source Core**: Transparent blockchain protocol with community-driven development
- **🤝 Community Owned**: No single entity controls SELF—it belongs to everyone

## 🚀 Key Features

### Revolutionary Consensus
- **Proof-of-AI (PoAI)**: The world's first AI-driven consensus mechanism
- **Color Marker System**: Advanced transaction validation through hexadecimal state tracking
- **AI Validators**: Intelligent block validation replacing energy-intensive mining

### Enterprise Ready
- **Constellation Architecture**: Deploy industry-specific chains for any regulated sector
- **Innovation Platform**: From healthcare to finance, build compliant blockchain solutions
- **Grid Compute**: Distributed AI computation across the network

### Developer First
- **Comprehensive SDKs**: JavaScript, Rust, Python, and Go (coming soon)
- **Testnet Available**: Early testnet for testing core functionality
- **Extensive Documentation**: World-class docs to get you started quickly

## 🛠️ Developer Preview

> 🚧 **EARLY ACCESS**: SELF Chain is in active development. Core blockchain functionality is working, but developer tools (SDKs, APIs, faucet) are currently in development. See our [Project Status](/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) for current capabilities.

> ⚠️ **TESTNET WARNING**: SELF Chain is currently in testnet phase. Do not use real assets or deploy production applications. Testnet tokens have no value and the network may be reset at any time.

### For Developers

**Note**: The instructions below require blockchain development experience and manual configuration. Easy-access tools are coming soon.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SELF-Technology/self-chain-public.git
cd self-chain-public

# Copy testnet configuration (Template available, testnet not yet deployed)
# cp config/testnet.example.toml config/testnet.toml

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run a testnet node (Note: Requires additional setup - see docs)
cargo run --bin self-chain-node -- --testnet
```

> 📄 **Important**: The above commands are provided for reference. Please see our [detailed testnet guide](https://docs.self.app/Technical%20Docs/Developer%20Resources/Getting_Started_Testnet) for complete setup instructions and current limitations.

### Get Testnet Tokens

> ⚠️ **Not Yet Available**: The testnet currently operates without a token economy. Token distribution via faucet is planned for the public testnet launch.

### Open Source Philosophy: The People's Chain

We believe in radical transparency with pragmatic security. As everyone should own and control their own data, we believe that everyone should be able to help construct and verify the chain.

**Open Source Components**:
- ✅ Core blockchain protocol
- ✅ Cryptographic implementations  
- ✅ Network protocols
- ✅ SDKs and APIs
- ✅ Documentation

**Security-Critical Components** (Private):
- 🔒 AI validation thresholds
- 🔒 Pattern matching algorithms
- 🔒 Security parameters

**The Future: SELF DAO**  
We're working towards creating SELF DAO to progressively decentralize governance, including oversight of security-critical components. This will ensure community control over the entire project—making SELF truly owned by the people who use and build it.

This approach, inspired by Signal, ensures both transparency and security while building towards complete community ownership.
