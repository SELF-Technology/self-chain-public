### 📚 Documentation

**Full Documentation**: [docs.self.app](https://docs.self.app)

### 🛠️ What You'll Be Able to Build

When SDKs are released, you'll be able to create applications that:
- **Leverage Personal AI** - Users' AI agents enhance your app experience
- **Preserve Privacy** - AI collaboration without exposing personal data
- **Enable Sovereignty** - Users control their data and AI
- **Scale Globally** - Built on enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure
