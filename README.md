# SELF - Creating the Future of Self-Sovereign Technology

## The Problem

Today's internet is broken. Tech giants harvest your data, control your digital life, and profit from your privacy. You've become the product.

## The Solution: SELF

SELF is reclaiming the internet for people. We're building the world's first **AI-powered blockchain** designed from the ground up for personal data sovereignty.

### 🎯 Our Mission

Every line of code, every design decision, every feature serves one purpose: **You own your digital life.**

- Privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing personal data
- One AI working seamlessly across all your applications

**🔐 Privacy by Design**
