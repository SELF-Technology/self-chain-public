## 💡 The SELF Difference

Unlike traditional tech companies that profit from your data, SELF creates a sustainable ecosystem where:

1. **You maintain privacy** - No data harvesting, ever
2. **You earn rewards** - Get tokens for participation
3. **You own your experience** - No ads or corporate interference

---

## 📄 License & Security

SELF Chain is open source software licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

### Open Source Model
SELF follows a selective open source approach similar to Signal. While our core protocol, cryptographic implementations, and client applications are fully open source, certain security-critical components (AI validation rules, pattern matching algorithms) remain closed source to prevent gaming of our consensus mechanism.

### Export Control Notice
This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for full export control information.
