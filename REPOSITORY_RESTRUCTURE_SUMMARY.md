# Repository Restructure Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the transformation of `self-chain-public` from a blockchain implementation repository to an open source SDK and documentation repository.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Repository Focus
- **Before**: Public blockchain implementation (security risk)
- **After**: Open source SDKs and documentation only

### 2. Directory Structure

#### Added:
```
sdk/
├── typescript/     # TypeScript/JavaScript SDK
├── python/         # Python SDK
├── rust/           # Rust SDK
├── go/            # Go SDK
└── api-spec/      # OpenAPI specification
```

#### Removed:
- `src/` - All blockchain implementation code (moved to private repo)
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` - Rust build files
- All blockchain source code

### 3. Updated Documentation

#### Major Updates:
1. **README.md** - Now focuses on SDKs and documentation
2. **Architecture docs** - Removed source code links
3. **Security docs** - Updated to reflect open ecosystem model
4. **Developer guides** - Shifted from "build blockchain" to "use SDKs"

#### New Documentation:
- `/docs/about-self/open-ecosystem-model.md` - Explains the selective open source approach

### 4. SDK Implementation

#### TypeScript SDK (`@self/sdk`):
- Full client implementation with HTTP and WebSocket support
- Type definitions for all API responses
- Real-time event subscriptions
- Example usage in README

#### Python SDK (`self-sdk`):
- Basic structure with setup.py
- Placeholder for client implementation
- Dependencies configured

#### Rust & Go SDKs:
- Project structure created
- Dependencies configured
- Ready for implementation

### 5. API Specification
- Moved from `/api` to `/sdk/api-spec`
- Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.1 specification
- Covers all endpoints developers will use
- Includes authentication, pagination, and examples

## Strategic Positioning

### Open Source Components:
- All SDKs (full source code)
- API specifications
- Documentation
- Example applications
- Development tools

### Private Components:
- Core blockchain implementation
- AI validation algorithms
- Infrastructure configurations
- Security-critical code

## Benefits

1. **Security**: No risk of exposing critical blockchain code
2. **Developer Experience**: Clear focus on what developers actually use
3. **Open Source Credibility**: Everything developers need is open
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Local Testing**: Serve docs locally with `npm start` to review all changes
2. **SDK Development**: Complete implementation of SDK clients
3. **Example Apps**: Create sample applications using SDKs
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all blockchain source references are removed

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Move blockchain code to private repo
- [x] Create SDK directory structure
- [x] Update README for new focus
- [x] Create Open Ecosystem Model doc
- [x] Update architecture documentation
- [x] Remove cargo/build references
- [x] Create API specification
- [x] Review all docs for remaining source code references
- [x] Test documentation site locally
- [x] Remove "Developing SELF" section entirely
- [x] Remove "Running Your Own Node" documentation
- [x] Remove "Getting Started Testnet" with node instructions
- [x] Update all documentation to focus on SDKs
- [x] Remove contribution references (not accepting yet)
- [x] Update main docs index page
- [x] Fix all broken links

## Important Notes

- All changes are LOCAL only (not committed)
- The private repository now contains all blockchain implementation
- Public repository maintains the open source narrative through SDKs

## Documentation Updates Summary

### Removed:
- `/docs/developing-self/` - Entire section about contributing to core blockchain
- `/docs/technical-docs/Cloud-Architecture/Running-Your-Own-Node.md` - Node running instructions
- `/docs/technical-docs/developer-resources/Getting_Started_Testnet.md` - Testnet node setup
- All references to `cargo build`, `cargo run`, building from source
- All references to contributing to the project (not ready for contributions)

### Updated:
- **Main README** - Now focuses on SDKs and documentation only
- **Documentation homepage** - Removed links to deleted sections, updated "Available Today"
- **Architecture docs** - Removed source code links, focused on concepts
- **Getting Started** - Rewritten to focus on future SDK usage, not node running
- **Project Status** - Updated to reflect SDK availability timeline

### Added:
- **Open Ecosystem Model** - New document explaining the selective open source approach
- **SDK Structure** - TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Go SDK scaffolding
- **API Specification** - Comprehensive OpenAPI spec in `/sdk/api-spec/`

## Result

The repository now clearly positions itself as:
1. **Open Source SDKs** - Everything developers need to build on SELF
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and references
3. **Community Hub** - For developers building applications

This maintains the open source narrative while protecting the security-critical blockchain implementation.
