<p>The Beta Web App is currently available to try free-of-charge, <a href="https://your.self.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here to sign up.</a>. You can check the uptime status by <a href="https://status.self.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clicking here</a>. This purpose of this is to simply test the agentic experience where SELF learns about each user during conversations (likes, dislikes, traits, habits, places you&#x27;ve been, goals, dreams etc.), and generates a user profile. You may also create your profile through manual input.</p>
<p>The current SELF default setting is to keep responses as clean and concise as possible, unless specified to do otherwise. SELF is all about honing in on the essentials, reducing noise while elevating signal. Later versions will introduce a slider functionality that allows users to regulate how concise or detailed SELF‚Äôs responses are.</p>
<p>The Web app is not symbolic of the forthcoming Super-App but enabled us to gain user feedback as we configured how people tend to use AI assistants. The following is the user guide in case you want to test the interface.</p>
<h1>User Guide</h1>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="get-started">Get Started<a href="#get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Get Started" title="Direct link to Get Started">‚Äã</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the &#x27;Sign Up&#x27; button in the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the required information (including a referral code if you have one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your email (incl junk folder just in case) for a six-digit code. Enter the code to complete the registration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#x27;s also possible to sign up through Google (all Google can see is your email address and you can revoke that access at any time).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="set-up-your-user-profile">Set Up Your User Profile<a href="#set-up-your-user-profile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Set Up Your User Profile" title="Direct link to Set Up Your User Profile">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>SELF aims to deliver a unique approach to personalisation and how it  organises its memory. It automatically learns about each user during conversations and generates a unique User Profile, with the goal of filtering the experience of the web into a personalised signal.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll gain the most benefit from using SELF, if you take 5-10 minutes to setup your SELF user profile.</p>
<p>A SELF-guided onboarding process (chat or voice) will develop and launch over time. For now, the best way to setup your profile is to submit answers to questions. Example questions are found below.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="explore-functionalities">Explore Functionalities<a href="#explore-functionalities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Explore Functionalities" title="Direct link to Explore Functionalities">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The more SELF knows about you, the more useful it becomes. It may be tempting to view SELF as an AI assistant and fire instructions at it, but the magic happens when you&#x27;ve trained your SELF to be a digital version of you.</p>
<p>SELF is eager to learn anything from your likes, dislikes, and future plans to personality traits, habits and the names of your significant others and stores this information in your User Profile.</p>
<p>You may find you use SELF to get personalised suggestions and recommendations, or to summarise information and produce summarised product reviews, based on what you&#x27;ve already told SELF you prefer. Or perhaps you use SELF as a advisor, offering personalised guidance and support.</p>
