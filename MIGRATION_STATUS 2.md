# Migration Status

This document summarizes the current status of the open source migration from the private repository.

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Deleted Stripe/Billing Code
- Removed all Stripe-related files from private repository
- Removed billing module references from public repository

### 2. Moved Core Infrastructure
Successfully migrated the following directories:
- `/src/blockchain/` - Core blockchain implementation
- `/src/consensus/` - Consensus mechanism (excluding AI validation rules)
- `/src/network/` - P2P networking and cloud protocol
- `/src/storage/` - IPFS and OrbitDB integration
- `/src/core/` - Node implementation
- `/src/crypto/` - All cryptographic implementations

### 3. Created Configuration Examples
- `/config/node-config.example.toml`
- `/config/network-config.example.toml`
- `/config/production.env.example`

### 4. Moved Test Suites
- `/tests/consensus_resilience/`
- `/tests/hybrid_storage_test.rs`
- `/tests/security_tests.rs`

### 5. Created Developer Documentation
- `/docs/Development/Running-A-Node.md`
- `/docs/Development/Network-Protocol.md`
- `/docs/Development/Storage-Integration.md`
- `/docs/Development/Consensus-Participation.md`

### 6. Set Up Build System
- Created `BUILD.md` with comprehensive build instructions
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Migrated `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`

### 7. Clean Private Repository
- Created `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` in private repository
- Updated private repository README to reflect migration

## Current Issues ðŸ”§

### Compilation Errors
The public repository currently has compilation errors due to:

1. **Module Structure**: Some modules need placeholder implementations for components that remain in the private repository
2. **AI Components**: Created placeholder implementations for AI validation components, but some interfaces need refinement
3. **Missing Types**: Some types and traits need to be properly abstracted to separate public interfaces from private implementations

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Abstract Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for AI validation that can be implemented in the private repository
2. **Fix Module Dependencies**: Resolve circular dependencies and missing type definitions
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that work with the open source components
4. **Documentation**: Add API documentation for all public interfaces

## Security Compliance âœ…

The migration follows the security parameters:
- âœ… Core protocol is open source
- âœ… Cryptographic implementations are fully open
- âœ… AI validation rules remain private
- âœ… Pattern matching algorithms remain private
- âœ… Security thresholds remain private
- âœ… Constellation API remains private

## Summary

The migration has successfully moved the core infrastructure to the public repository while maintaining security-critical components in the private repository. The public repository structure is in place with documentation and build systems configured. Some compilation issues remain that require creating proper abstractions between public interfaces and private implementations.
