# Algolia Search Setup for Production

The Algolia search is configured but needs environment variables set in production.

## Environment Variables Required

```
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=0X1QYF886S
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=529f2d29487ab836fe56f52b39493466
```

## Security Considerations

While Algolia search-only API keys are designed to be exposed publicly, they can still be misused for:
- Scraping all index data
- Flooding the account with search requests

### Recommended: Generate a Secured API Key

Instead of using the basic search API key, generate a secured API key with restrictions:

1. Go to your Algolia dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Create a new secured search-only API key with:
   - Rate limiting
   - Index restrictions (only 'self' index)
   - Referer restrictions (only from your domain)
   - Valid until date (optional)

## Setting up in Cloudflare Pages

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment variables
3. Add the following variables for Production:
   - `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` = `0X1QYF886S`
   - `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY` = `[your secured API key]`
4. Redeploy the site for changes to take effect

## Verifying Algolia Index

Make sure your Algolia index named 'self' exists and is populated with your documentation content.

## Note on Hardcoding

Avoid hardcoding API keys directly in source code as security scanners will flag this as a vulnerability (SCT-1035). Always use environment variables for production deployments.
