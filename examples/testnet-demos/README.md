# SELF Chain Testnet Example Applications

:::warning TESTNET ONLY
These examples are for testnet use only:
- Do not use with real assets or in production environments
- Testnet tokens have ZERO monetary value
- Network may reset at any time without notice
- All data is temporary and will be lost
:::

## Overview

This directory contains example applications demonstrating how to build on SELF Chain testnet. Each example includes prominent warnings about testnet usage and safe development practices.

## Available Examples

### 1. Hello SELF (Basic Connection)
Simple example showing how to connect to SELF Chain testnet and query basic information.

**What you'll learn**:
- Connecting to testnet
- Reading blockchain state
- Handling testnet warnings

### 2. Token Transfer Demo
Demonstrates sending TEST tokens between accounts.

:::caution
Testnet tokens have ZERO monetary value and cannot be exchanged for real assets.
:::

**What you'll learn**:
- Creating transactions
- Signing with testnet keys
- Broadcasting to network
- Checking transaction status

### 3. Block Explorer Lite
A minimal block explorer showing recent blocks and transactions.

**What you'll learn**:
- Subscribing to new blocks
- Querying historical data
- Displaying blockchain information
- Real-time updates

### 4. Simple Wallet
Basic wallet interface for testnet operations.

**What you'll learn**:
- Key generation (testnet only - NEVER use these keys for real assets)
- Balance checking
- Transaction history
- QR code generation

## Important Testnet Guidelines

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use these examples to learn SELF Chain concepts
- ‚úÖ Experiment freely with testnet tokens
- ‚úÖ Report bugs you find
- ‚úÖ Modify examples for your own learning
- ‚úÖ Share your testnet creations with the community

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Use these examples with real cryptocurrency
- ‚ùå Deploy to production
- ‚ùå Share private keys (even testnet ones)
- ‚ùå Expect persistent data (testnet may reset)
- ‚ùå Try to sell or trade testnet tokens

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# or with yarn
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env.testnet

# Edit .env.testnet with your testnet configuration
# WARNING: NEVER use mainnet endpoints or keys!
```

### Running Examples

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
# Example 1: Hello SELF
npm run example:hello

# Example 2: Token Transfer
npm run example:transfer

# Example 3: Block Explorer
npm run example:explorer

# Example 4: Simple Wallet
npm run example:wallet
```

## Code Structure

Each example follows this structure:
```
example-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js          # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Specific instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js         # Testnet configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ warnings.js   # Testnet warning displays
```

## Security Considerations

Even in testnet examples, we follow security best practices:

1. **No Hardcoded Keys**: All examples use environment variables
2. **Testnet Detection**: Automatic checks prevent mainnet usage
3. **Warning Messages**: Clear indicators of testnet status
4. **Safe Defaults**: Conservative limits and timeouts
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with helpful messages

## Contributing Examples

We welcome new example contributions! Please ensure:

1. **Testnet Only**: Must work exclusively on testnet
2. **Educational Value**: Should teach specific concepts
3. **Clear Documentation**: README with learning objectives
4. **Warning Messages**: Prominent testnet warnings
5. **Code Quality**: Follow our style guide
6. **No Security Risks**: Don't expose sensitive patterns
