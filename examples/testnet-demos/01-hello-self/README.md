# Hello SELF - Basic Connection Example

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **TESTNET ONLY**: This example only works with testnet. Never use real assets!

## Overview

This is the simplest example showing how to connect to SELF Chain testnet and query basic information. It's the perfect starting point for developers new to SELF Chain.

## What You'll Learn

- How to connect to SELF Chain testnet
- Querying network information
- Understanding block structure
- Getting testnet tokens from faucet
- Proper testnet safety practices

## Running the Example

## Code Structure

```javascript
// 1. Safety First - Always show testnet warning
TestnetWarning.display();

// 2. Configuration - Testnet only
const config = {
  network: 'testnet',
  endpoint: 'https://testnet-api.self.app'
};

// 3. Connection - With safety checks
const client = new SELFClient(config);
await client.connect();

// 4. Query Data - Read-only operations
const networkInfo = await client.getNetworkInfo();
const latestBlock = await client.getLatestBlock();
```

## Key Concepts

### Proof-of-AI (PoAI)
SELF Chain uses AI-powered consensus instead of traditional mining. The `aiScore` in blocks represents the AI validation confidence.

### Testnet vs Mainnet
- **Testnet**: For testing and development (this example)
- **Mainnet**: For real transactions (not yet launched)

### Network Information
- `chainId`: Unique identifier for the network
- `blockHeight`: Number of blocks in the chain
- `blockTime`: Average time between blocks
- `validators`: Number of active validators

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the testnet endpoint is correct
- Ensure you're not accidentally using mainnet config

### Need Testnet Tokens?
1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/WdMdVpA4C8)
2. Go to #testnet-faucet channel
3. Use command: `!faucet your_testnet_address`

## Next Steps

Once you've successfully run this example:

1. **Get Testnet Tokens**: Follow the faucet instructions
2. **Try Example 2**: Learn to transfer tokens
3. **Explore the SDK**: Check SDK documentation (when released)
4. **Build Something**: Create your own testnet application

## Security Notes

Even though this is testnet:
- Never share private keys
- Don't reuse passwords from other services
- Report any security issues to security@self.app
