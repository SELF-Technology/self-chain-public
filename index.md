## Welcome to SELF

SELF is building the future of technology where users maintain complete sovereignty over their digital lives. Through our revolutionary Proof-of-AI consensus mechanism and quantum-secure architecture, we're creating an ecosystem where privacy, ownership, and freedom are fundamental rights, not optional features.
