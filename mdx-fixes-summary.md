# MDX Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Reverted Escaped Numbers
- Ran sed command to change all "1\." back to "1." in all markdown files
- This affected numbered lists throughout the documentation

### 2. Fixed Industry_Validation_Rules.md
Location: `/docs/Constellation/Industry_Validation_Rules.md`

Specific fixes:
- Added blank lines before numbered lists (4 instances)
- Added blank lines around the table in the Implementation Statistics section

### Common MDX Issues to Watch For

1. **Numbered Lists**: MDX requires blank lines before and after numbered lists
2. **Tables**: Tables should have blank lines before and after them
3. **Bold text in lists**: Generally works fine, but can sometimes cause issues
4. **Inline HTML**: Should be avoided in MDX files
5. **Special characters**: Characters like < and > might need escaping

### Files Modified
- All markdown files had escaped numbers reverted
- `/docs/Constellation/Industry_Validation_Rules.md` had specific MDX formatting fixes

### Recommendation
If MDX errors persist, look for:
- Lists without proper spacing
- Tables without blank lines around them
- Any inline HTML elements
- Special characters that might need escaping
